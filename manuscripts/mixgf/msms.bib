abstract = {The BLAST programs are widely used tools for searching protein and DNA databases for sequence similarities. For protein comparisons, a variety of definitional, algorithmic and statistical refinements described here permits the execution time of the BLAST programs to be decreased substantially while enhancing their sensitivity to weak similarities. A new criterion for triggering the extension of word hits, combined with a new heuristic for generating gapped alignments, yields a gapped BLAST program that runs at approximately three times the speed of the original. In addition, a method is introduced for automatically combining statistically significant alignments produced by BLAST into a position-specific score matrix, and searching the database using this matrix. The resulting Position-Specific Iterated BLAST (PSI-BLAST) program runs at approximately the same speed per iteration as gapped BLAST, but in many cases is much more sensitive to weak but biologically relevant sequence similarities. PSI-BLAST is used to uncover several new and interesting members of the BRCT superfamily.},

title = {Protein database searches using compositionally adjusted substitution matrices},
abstract = {Almost all protein database search methods use amino acid substitution matrices for scoring, optimizing, and assessing the statistical significance of sequence alignments. Much care and effort has therefore gone into constructing substitution matrices, and the quality of search results can depend strongly upon the choice of the proper matrix. A long-standing problem has been the comparison of sequences with biased amino acid compositions, for which standard substitution matrices are not optimal. To address this problem, we have recently developed a general procedure for transforming a standard matrix into one appropriate for the comparison of two sequences with arbitrary, and possibly differing compositions. Such adjusted matrices yield, on average, improved alignments and alignment scores when applied to the comparison of proteins with markedly biased compositions. Here we review the application of compositionally adjusted matrices and consider whether they may also be applied fruitfully to general purpose protein sequence database searches, in which related sequence pairs do not necessarily have strong compositional biases. Although it is not advisable to apply compositional adjustment indiscriminately, we describe several simple criteria under which invoking such adjustment is on average beneficial. In a typical database search, at least one of these criteria is satisfied by over half the related sequence pairs. Compositional substitution matrix adjustment is now available in NCBI's protein-protein version of blast.},

title = {Robust accurate identification of peptides (RAId): deciphering MS2 data using a structured library search with de novo based statistics},
abstract = {MOTIVATION: The key to MS -based proteomics is peptide sequencing. The major challenge in peptide sequencing, whether library search or de novo, is to better infer statistical significance and better attain noise reduction. Since the noise in a spectrum depends on experimental conditions, the instrument used and many other factors, it cannot be predicted even if the peptide sequence is known. The characteristics of the noise can only be uncovered once a spectrum is given. We wish to overcome such issues. RESULTS: We designed RAId to identify peptides from their associated tandem mass spectrometry data. RAId performs a novel de novo sequencing followed by a search in a peptide library that we created. Through de novo sequencing, we establish the spectrum-specific background score statistics for the library search. When the database search fails to return significant hits, the top-ranking de novo sequences become potential candidates for new peptides that are not yet in the database. The use of spectrum-specific background statistics seems to enable RAId to perform well even when the spectral quality is marginal. Other important features of RAId include its potential in de novo sequencing alone and the ease of incorporating post-translational modifications.},

abstract = {In peptide sequencing experiments involving a single step tandem mass acquisition, leucine and isoleucine are indistinguishable because both are characterized by a 113 Da mass difference from the other peptide fragments in the MS2 spectrum. In this work, we propose a new method to distinguish between these two amino acids in consecutive MSn experiments, exploiting a gas-phase fragmentation of isoleucine that leads to a diagnostic 69 Da ion. We used this method to assess the Leu/Ile residues of several synthetic peptides. The procedure was then tested on a tryptic digest of myoglobin, assigning the correct amino acid in the majority of the peptides. This work was performed with an old and low-resolution instrument, thus demonstrating that our method is suitable for a wide number of ion trap mass spectrometers, not necessarily expensive or up-to-date.},

Recent technological advances in tandem mass spectrometry has made it the method of choice for high-throughput identification of proteins. Unfortunately, the software for unambiguously identifying peptide sequences has not kept pace with the recent hardware improvements in mass spectrometry instruments. Critical for reliable high-throughput protein identification, scoring functions evaluate the quality of a match between experimental spectra and a database peptide. Current scoring function technology relies heavily on ad-hoc parameterization and manual curation by experienced mass spectrometrists. In this work, we propose a two-stage stochastic model for the observed MS/MS spectrum, given a peptide.

Analysis of data produced by such experiments offers potential insight into gene function and regulatory mechanisms. A key step in the analysis of gene expression data is the detection of groups of genes that manifest similar expression patterns. The corresponding algorithmic problem is to cluster multicondition gene expression patterns. In this paper we describe a novel clustering algorithm that was developed for analysis of gene expression data. We define an appropriate stochastic error model on the input, and prove that under the conditions of the model, the algorithm recovers the cluster structure with high probability. The running time of the algorithm on an n-gene dataset is O[n2[log(n)]c]. We also present a practical heuristic based on the same algorithmic ideas. The heuristic was implemented and its performance is demonstrated on simulated data and on real gene expression data, with very promising results.},

We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by comparison with other de novo sequencers on test sets of ion-trap and QTOF spectra, including spectra of mixtures of peptides. On all datasets, we outperform the other sequencers. Along with spectral graph theory techniques, the new de novo sequencer EigenMS incorporates another improvement of independent interest: robust statistical methods for recalibration of time-of-flight mass measurements. Robust recalibration greatly outperforms simple least-squares recalibration, achieving about three times the accuracy for one QTOF dataset.},

Here we show using deuterium exchange/mass spectrometry coupled with hydrodynamic measures that CENP-A and histone H4 form sub-nucleosomal tetramers that are more compact and conformationally more rigid than the corresponding tetramers of histones H3 and H4. Substitution into histone H3 of the domain of CENP-A responsible for compaction is sufficient to direct it to centromeres.

Dual-specific AKAP2 (D-AKAP2) binds in the nanomolar range to both isoforms and provided us with an opportunity to characterize the isoform-selective nature of AKAP binding using a common docked ligand. Hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange combined with mass spectrometry (DXMS) was used to probe backbone structural changes of an alpha-helical A-kinase binding (AKB) motif from D-AKAP2 docked to both RIalpha and RIIalpha D/D domains. The region of protection upon complex formation and the magnitude of protection from H/D exchange were determined for both interacting partners in each complex. The backbone of the AKB ligand was more protected when bound to RIalpha compared to RIIalpha, suggesting an increased helical stabilization of the docked AKB ligand. This combined with a broader region of backbone protection induced by the AKAP on the docking surface of RIalpha indicated that there were more binding constraints for the AKB ligand when bound to RIalpha. This was in contrast to RIIalpha, which has a preformed, localized binding surface. These distinct modes of AKAP binding may contribute to the more discriminating nature of the RIalpha AKAP-docking surface. DXMS provides valuable structural information for understanding binding specificity in the absence of a high-resolution structure, and can readily be applied to other protein-ligand and protein-protein interactions.}",

In theory, the peak area of peptides should correlate to their concentration; hence, the peak areas of peptides from one protein should correlate to the concentration of that particular protein. To evaluate this hypothesis, different amounts of tryptic digests of myoglobin were analyzed by LC/MS in a wide range between 10 fmol and 100 pmol. The results show that the peak areas from liquid chromatography mass spectrometry correlate linearly to the concentration of the protein (r2 = 0.991). The method was further evaluated by adding two different concentrations of horse myoglobin to human serum. The results confirm that the quantitation method can also be used for quantitative profiling of proteins in complex mixtures such as human sera.

title = {Modeling and characterization of multi-charge mass spectra for peptide sequencing},
abstract = {Peptide sequencing using tandem mass spectrometry data is an important and challenging problem in proteomics. We address the problem of peptide sequencing for multi-charge spectra. Most peptide sequencing algorithms currently consider only charge one or two ions even for higher-charge spectra. We give a characterization of multi-charge spectra by generalizing existing models. Using our models, we analyzed spectra from Global Proteome Machine (GPM) [Craig R, Cortens JP, Beavis RC, J Proteome Res 3:1234-1242, 2004.] (with charges 1-5), Institute for Systems Biology (ISB) [Keller A, Purvine S, Nesvizhskii AI, Stolyar S, Goodlett DR, Kolker E, OMICS 6:207-212, 2002.] and Orbitrap (both with charges 1-3). Our analysis for the GPM dataset shows that higher charge peaks contribute significantly to prediction of the complete peptide. They also help to explain why existing algorithms do not perform well on multi-charge spectra. Based on these analyses, we claim that peptide sequencing algorithms can achieve higher sensitivity results if they also consider higher charge ions. We verify this claim by proposing a de novo sequencing algorithm called the greedy best strong tag (GBST) algorithm that is simple but considers higher charge ions based on our new model. Evaluation on multi-charge spectra shows that our simple GBST algorithm outperforms Lutefisk and PepNovo, especially for the GPM spectra of charge three or more.},

Mass spectrometric analysis of intact betaB1 from young human lens confirmed the deduced amino acid sequence. Lenses of human donors newborn to 27 years of age also contained partially degraded forms of betaB1 missing 15, 33, 34, 35, 36, 39, 40, and 41 amino acid residues from their N-terminal extensions. The similarity of the cleavage site between residues 15 and 16 in human betaB1 to the cleavage occurring in bovine betaB1 suggested that lenses of both species may contain a similar proteolytic activity. The remaining cleavage sites occurring in human betaB1 did not closely match those occurring in other species, possibly due to the widely divergent amino acid sequence of the N-terminal extension of betaB1 amoung species. Results from animal models suggest that cleavage of the N-terminal extension of betaB1-crystallin could enhance protein insolubilization and cataract in lens. However, the presence of partially degraded betaB1-crystallins in both water-soluble and water-insoluble fractions of lenses of young donors suggested that the rate that proteolyzed betaB1-crystallins become water-insoluble is relatively slow in humans.},

The various features of the mathematical model are presented and examples are used to illustrate the key concepts of the proposed approach. A variety of challenging peptide identification problems, accompanied by a comparative study with five state-of-the-art methods, are examined to illustrate the proposed method's ability to address (a) residue-dependent fragmentation properties that result in missing ion peaks and (b) the variability of resolution in different mass analyzers. A preprocessing algorithm is utilized to identify important m/z values in the tandem mass spectrum. Missing peaks, due to residue-dependent fragmentation characteristics, are dealt with using a two-stage algorithmic framework. A cross-correlation approach is used to resolve missing amino acid assignments and to select the most probable peptide by comparing the theoretical spectra of the candidate sequences that were generated from the ILP sequencing stages with the experimental tandem mass spectrum. The novel, proposed de novo method, denoted as PILOT, is compared to existing popular methods such as Lutefisk, PEAKS, PepNovo, EigenMS, and NovoHMM for a set of spectra resulting from QTOF and ion trap instruments.},

abstract = {The extension of quantitation methods for small peptides to ions above 5 kDa, and eventually to global quantitative proteomics of intact proteins, will require extensive refinement of current analytical approaches. Here we evaluate postgrowth Cys-labeling and (14)N/(15)N metabolic labeling strategies for determination of relative protein expression levels and their posttranslational modifications using top-down mass spectrometry (MS). We show that intact proteins that are differentially alkylated with acrylamide (+71 Da) versus iodoacetamide (+57 Da) have substantial chromatographic shifts during reversed-phase liquid chromatography separation (particularly in peak tails), indicating a requirement for stable isotopes in alkylation tags for top-down MS. In the (14)N/(15)N metabolic labeling strategy, we achieve 98% (15)N incorporation in yeast grown 10 generations under aerobic conditions and determine 50 expression ratios using Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance MS in comparing these cells to anaerobically grown control ((14)N) cells. We devise quantitative methods for top-down analyses, including a correction factor for accurate protein ratio determination based upon the signal-to-noise ratio. Using a database of 200 yeast protein forms identified previously by top-down MS, we verify the intact mass tag concept for protein identification without tandem MS. Overall, we find that top-down MS promises work flows capable of large-scale proteome profiling using stable isotope labeling and the determination of >5 protein ratios per spectrum.},

title = {Speeding up tandem mass spectrometry database search: metric embeddings and fast near neighbor search},
abstract = {MOTIVATION: Due to the recent advances in technology of mass spectrometry, there has been an exponential increase in the amount of data being generated in the past few years. Database searches have not been able to keep with this data explosion. Thus, speeding up the data searches becomes increasingly important in mass-spectrometry-based applications. Traditional database search methods use one-against-all comparisons of a query spectrum against a very large number of peptides generated from in silico digestion of protein sequences in a database, to filter potential candidates from this database followed by a detailed scoring and ranking of those filtered candidates. RESULTS: In this article, we show that we can avoid the one-against-all comparisons. The basic idea is to design a set of hash functions to pre-process peptides in the database such that for each query spectrum we can use the hash functions to find only a small subset of peptide sequences that are most likely to match the spectrum. The construction of each hash function is based on a random spectrum and the hash value of a peptide is the normalized shared peak counts score (cosine) between the random spectrum and the hypothetical spectrum of the peptide. To implement this idea, we first embed each peptide into a unit vector in a high-dimensional metric space. The random spectrum is represented by a random vector, and we use random vectors to construct a set of hash functions called locality sensitive hashing (LSH) for preprocessing. We demonstrate that our mapping is accurate. We show that our method can filter out >95.65% of the spectra without missing any correct sequences, or gain 111 times speedup by filtering out 99.64% of spectra while missing at most 0.19% (2 out of 1014) of the correct sequences. In addition, we show that our method can be effectively used for other mass spectra mining applications such as finding clusters of spectra efficiently and accurately.

Traditional search engines, which match peptide sequences with tandem mass spectra to identify the samples' proteins, use protein sequence databases to suggest peptide candidates for consideration. Although the acquisition of tandem mass spectra is not biased toward well-understood protein isoforms, this computational strategy is failing to identify peptides from alternative splicing and coding SNP protein isoforms despite the acquisition of good-quality tandem mass spectra. We propose, instead, that expressed sequence tags (ESTs) be searched. Ordinarily, such a strategy would be computationally infeasible due to the size of EST sequence databases; however, we show that a sophisticated sequence database compression strategy, applied to human ESTs, reduces the sequence database size approximately 35-fold. Once compressed, our EST sequence database is comparable in size to other commonly used protein sequence databases, making routine EST searching feasible. We demonstrate that our EST sequence database enables the discovery of novel peptides in a variety of public data sets.},

title = {Fast tandem mass spectra-based protein identification regardless of the number of spectra or potential modifications examined},
abstract = {MOTIVATION: Comparing tandem mass spectra (MSMS) against a known dataset of protein sequences is a common method for identifying unknown proteins; however, the processing of MSMS by current software often limits certain applications, including comprehensive coverage of post-translational modifications, non-specific searches and real-time searches to allow result-dependent instrument control. This problem deserves attention as new mass spectrometers provide the ability for higher throughput and as known protein datasets rapidly grow in size. New software algorithms need to be devised in order to address the performance issues of conventional MSMS protein dataset-based protein identification. METHODS: This paper describes a novel algorithm based on converting a collection of monoisotopic, centroided spectra to a new data structure, named 'peptide finite state machine' (PFSM), which may be used to rapidly search a known dataset of protein sequences, regardless of the number of spectra searched or the number of potential modifications examined. The algorithm is verified using a set of commercially available tryptic digest protein standards analyzed using an ABI 4700 MALDI TOFTOF mass spectrometer, and a free, open source PFSM implementation. It is illustrated that a PFSM can accurately search large collections of spectra against large datasets of protein sequences (e.g. NCBI nr) using a regular desktop PC; however, this paper only details the method for identifying peptide and subsequently protein candidates from a dataset of known protein sequences. The concept of using a PFSM as a peptide pre-screening technique for MSMS-based search engines is validated by using PFSM with Mascot and XTandem. AVAILABILITY: Complete source code, documentation and examples for the reference PFSM implementation are freely available at the Proteome Commons, http://www.proteomecommons.org and source code may be used both commercially and non-commercially as long as the original authors are credited for their work.},

title = {Clustering millions of tandem mass spectra},
abstract = {Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) experiments often generate redundant data sets containing multiple spectra of the same peptides. Clustering of MS/MS spectra takes advantage of this redundancy by identifying multiple spectra of the same peptide and replacing them with a single representative spectrum. Analyzing only representative spectra results in significant speed-up of MS/MS database searches. We present an efficient clustering approach for analyzing large MS/MS data sets (over 10 million spectra) with a capability to reduce the number of spectra submitted to further analysis by an order of magnitude. The MS/MS database search of clustered spectra results in fewer spurious hits to the database and increases number of peptide identifications as compared to regular nonclustered searches. Our open source software MS-Clustering is available for download at http://peptide.ucsd.edu or can be run online at http://proteomics.bioprojects.org/MassSpec.},

title = {De novo peptide sequencing and identification with precision mass spectrometry},
abstract = {The recent proliferation of novel mass spectrometers such as Fourier transform, QTOF, and OrbiTrap marks a transition into the era of precision mass spectrometry, providing a 2 orders of magnitude boost to the mass resolution, as compared to low-precision ion-trap detectors. We investigate peptide de novo sequencing by precision mass spectrometry and explore some of the differences when compared to analysis of low-precision data. We demonstrate how the dramatically improved performance of de novo sequencing with precision mass spectrometry paves the way for novel approaches to peptide identification that are based on direct sequence lookups, rather than comparisons of spectra to a database. With the direct sequence lookup, it is not only possible to search a database very efficiently, but also to use the database in novel ways, such as searching for products of alternative splicing or products of fusion proteins in cancer.

abstract = {A widespread proteomics procedure for characterizing a complex mixture of proteins combines tandem mass spectrometry and database search software to yield mass spectra with identified peptide sequences. The same peptides are often detected in multiple experiments, and once they have been identified, the respective spectra can be used for future identifications. We present a method for collecting previously identified tandem mass spectra into a reference library that is used to identify new spectra. Query spectra are compared to references in the library to find the ones that are most similar. A dot product metric is used to measure the degree of similarity. With our largest library, the search of a query set finds 91% of the spectrum identifications and 93.7% of the protein identifications that could be made with a SEQUEST database search. A second experiment demonstrates that queries acquired on an LCQ ion trap mass spectrometer can be identified with a library of references acquired on an LTQ ion trap mass spectrometer. The dot product similarity score provides good separation of correct and incorrect identifications.},

Inference with the graphical model for de novo peptide sequencing estimates posterior probabilities for amino acids rather than scores for single symbols in the sequence.

The application of mass spectrometry based techniques for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of global proteome samples derived from complex mixtures has had a big impact in the understanding of cellular function. Here, we give a brief introduction to principles of mass spectrometry and instrumentation currently used in proteomics experiments. In addition, recent developments in the application of mass spectrometry in proteomics are summarised. Strategies allowing high-throughput identification of proteins from highly complex mixtures include accurate mass measurement of peptides derived from total proteome digests and multidimensional peptide separations coupled with mass spectrometry. Mass spectrometric analysis of intact proteins permits the characterisation of protein isoforms. Recent developments in stable isotope labelling techniques and chemical tagging allow the mass spectrometry based differential display and quantitation of proteins, and newly established affinity procedures enable the targeted characterisation of post-translationally modified proteins. Finally, advances in mass spectrometric imaging allow the gathering of specific information on the local molecular composition, relative abundance and spatial distribution of peptides and proteins in thin tissue sections.},

abstract = {While bacterial genome annotations have significantly improved in recent years, techniques for bacterial proteome annotation (including post-translational chemical modifications, signal peptides, proteolytic events, etc.) are still in their infancy. At the same time, the number of sequenced bacterial genomes is rising sharply, far outpacing our ability to validate the predicted genes, let alone annotate bacterial proteomes. In this study, we use tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to annotate the proteome of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, an important microbe for bioremediation. In particular, we provide the first comprehensive map of post-translational modifications in a bacterial genome, including a large number of chemical modifications, signal peptide cleavages, and cleavages of N-terminal methionine residues. We also detect multiple genes that were missed or assigned incorrect start positions by gene prediction programs, and suggest corrections to improve the gene annotation. This study demonstrates that complementing every genome sequencing project by an MS/MS project would significantly improve both genome and proteome annotations for a reasonable cost.},

We used these two probabilistic models to compute the relative likelihood of an observed spectrum given that a candidate peptide is matched or mismatched.

While information is unfolding regarding specific binding motifs, very little is known about the overall structure and dynamics of these scaffold proteins. We have used deuterium exchange-mass spectrometry (DXMS) and limited proteolysis to probe the folded regions of D-AKAP2, providing for the first time insight into the intra-domain dynamics of a scaffold protein. Deuterium on-exchange revealed two regions of low deuterium exchange that were surrounded by regions of high exchange, suggestive of two distinctly folded regions, flanked by disordered or solvent accessible regions. Similar folded regions were detected by limited proteolysis. The first folded region contained a putative regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) domain. A structural model of the RGS domain revealed that the more deuterated regions mapped onto loops and turns, whereas less deuterated regions mapped onto alpha-helices, consistent with this region folding into an RGS domain. The second folded region contained a highly protected PKA binding site and a more solvent-accessible PDZ binding motif, which may serve as a potential targeting domain for D-AKAP2. DXMS has verified the multi-domain architecture of D-AKAP2 implied by sequence homology and has provided unique insight into the accessibility of the PKA binding site.}",

abstract = "{cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cAPK) is a key component in numerous cell signaling pathways. The cAPK regulatory (R) subunit maintains the kinase in an inactive state until cAMP saturation of the R-subunit leads to activation of the enzyme. To delineate the conformational changes associated with cAPK activation, the amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange in the cAPK type IIbeta R-subunit was probed by electrospray mass spectrometry. Three states of the R-subunit, cAMP-bound, catalytic (C)-subunit bound, and apo, were incubated in deuterated water for various lengths of time and then, prior to mass spectrometry analysis, subjected to digestion by pepsin to localize the deuterium incorporation. High sequence coverage (>99%) by the pepsin-digested fragments enables us to monitor the dynamics of the whole protein. The effects of cAMP binding on RIIbeta amide hydrogen exchange are restricted to the cAMP-binding pockets, while the effects of C-subunit binding are evident across both cAMP-binding domains and the linker region. The decreased amide hydrogen exchange for residues 253-268 within cAMP binding domain A and for residues 102-115, which include the pseudosubstrate inhibitory site, support the prediction that these two regions represent the conserved primary and peripheral C-subunit binding sites. An increase in amide hydrogen exchange for a broad area within cAMP-binding domain B and a narrow area within cAMP-binding domain A (residues 222-232) suggest that C-subunit binding transmits long-distance conformational changes throughout the protein.}",

abstract = "{Protein kinase A (PKA), a central locus for cAMP signaling in the cell, is composed of regulatory (R) and catalytic (C) subunits. The C-subunits are maintained in an inactive state by binding to the R-subunit dimer in a tetrameric holoenzyme complex (R(2)C(2)). PKA is activated by cAMP binding to the R-subunits which induces a conformational change leading to release of the active C-subunit. Enzymatic activity of the C-subunit is thus regulated by cAMP via the R-subunit, which toggles between cAMP and C-subunit bound states. The R-subunit is composed of a dimerization/docking (D/D) domain connected to two cAMP-binding domains (cAMP:A and cAMP:B). While crystal structures of the free C-subunit and cAMP-bound states of a deletion mutant of the R-subunit are known, there is no structure of the holoenzyme complex or of the cAMP-free state of the R-subunit. An important step in understanding the cAMP-dependent activation of PKA is to map the R-C interface and characterize the mutually exclusive interactions of the R-subunit with cAMP and C-subunit. Amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry is a suitable method that has provided insights into the different states of the R-subunit in solution, thereby allowing mapping of the effects of cAMP and C-subunit on different regions of the R-subunit. Our study has localized interactions with the C-subunit to a small contiguous surface on the cAMP:A domain and the linker region. In addition, C-subunit binding causes increased amide hydrogen exchange within both cAMP-domains, suggesting that these regions become more flexible in the holoenzyme and are primed to bind cAMP. Furthermore, the difference in the protection patterns between RIalpha and the previously studied RIIbeta upon cAMP-binding suggests isoform-specific differences in cAMP-dependent regulation of PKA activity.}",

The resulting sequence of 106 amino acids is as follows: Ac-Ala-Gln-Glu-Phe-Val-Asn-Ser-Lys-Ile-Gln-Pro-Gly-Lys-Val-Val-Val-Phe- Ile-Lys-Pro-Thr-Cys-Pro-Tyr-Cys-Arg-Lys-Thr-Gln-Glu-Ile-Leu-Ser-Glu-Leu- Pro-Phe - Lys-Gln-Gly-Leu-Leu-Glu-Phe- Val-Asp-Ile-Thr-Ala-Thr-Ser-Asp-Met-Ser-Glu-Ile- Gln-Asp-Tyr-Leu-Gln-Gln-Leu-Thr-Gly-Ala-Arg- Thr-Val-Pro-Arg-Val-Phe-Leu-Gly-Lys-Asp-Cys-Ile- Gly-Gly-Cys-Ser-Asp-Leu-Ile-Ala-Met-Gln-Glu-Lys- Gly-Glu-Leu-Leu-Ala-Arg-Leu-Lys-Glu-Met-Gly- Ala-Leu-Arg-Gln. This glutaredoxin strongly resembles the corresponding calf and pig proteins (known as glutaredoxin and thioltransferase, respectively) with respect to its primary structure and enzymatic activity as a GSH:disulfide thioltransferase, an activity also found for the glutaredoxin from Escherichia coli. However, rabbit glutaredoxin was not active as a hydrogen donor for the reduction of ribonucleotides in the presence of the ribonucleotide reductases from rabbit bone marrow, Lactobacillus leichmannii, and Corynebacterium nephridii.}",

abstract = {Data mining was performed on 28 330 unique peptide tandem mass spectra for which sequences were assigned with high confidence. By dividing the spectra into different sets based on structural features and charge states of the corresponding peptides, chemical interactions involved in promoting specific cleavage patterns in gas-phase peptides were characterized. Pairwise fragmentation maps describing cleavages at all Xxx-Zzz residue combinations for b and y ions reveal that the difference in basicity between Arg and Lys results in different dissociation patterns for singly charged Arg- and Lys-ending tryptic peptides. While one dominant protonation form (proton localized) exists for Arg-ending peptides, a heterogeneous population of different protonated forms or more facile interconversion of protonated forms (proton partially mobile) exists for Lys-ending peptides. Cleavage C-terminal to acidic residues dominates spectra from singly charged peptides that have a localized proton and cleavage N-terminal to Pro dominates those that have a mobile or partially mobile proton. When Pro is absent from peptides that have a mobile or partially mobile proton, cleavage at each peptide bond becomes much more prominent. Whether the above patterns can be found in b ions, y ions, or both depends on the location of the proton holder(s) in multiply protonated peptides. Enhanced cleavages C-terminal to branched aliphatic residues (Ile, Val, Leu) are observed in both b and y ions from peptides that have a mobile proton, as well as in y ions from peptides that have a partially mobile proton; enhanced cleavages N-terminal to these residues are observed in b ions from peptides that have a partially mobile proton. Statistical tools have been designed to visualize the fragmentation maps and measure the similarity between them. The pairwise cleavage patterns observed expand our knowledge of peptide gas-phase fragmentation behaviors and may be useful in algorithm development that employs improved models to predict fragment ion intensities.},

Shortly thereafter a few groups pioneered the idea of identifying proteins by using peptide tandem mass spectra to search protein sequence databases. Hence, it became possible to identify proteins from very complex mixtures. One drawback to these latter techniques is that it is not entirely straightforward to make matches using tandem mass spectra of peptides that are modified or have sequences that differ slightly from what is present in the sequence database that is being searched. This has been part of the motivation behind automated de novo sequencing programs that attempt to derive a peptide sequence regardless of its presence in a sequence database. The sequence candidates thus generated are then subjected to homology-based database search programs (e.g., BLAST or FASTA). These homology search programs, however, were not developed with mass spectrometry in mind, and it became necessary to make minor modifications such that mass spectrometric ambiguities can be taken into account when comparing query and database sequences. Finally, this review will discuss the important issue of validating protein identifications.

abstract = {A method is presented for the rapid detection and characterization of trace amounts of peptides secreted from microorganisms, including pheromones, virulence factors, and quorum-sensing peptides. The procedure, based on targeted multistage MS, uses a novel matrix-assisted laser desorptionionization-ion trap mass spectrometer to overcome limitations of current MS methods (limited dynamic range, signal suppression effects, and chemical noise) that impair observation of low abundance peptides from complex biological matrixes. Here, secreted peptides that are hypothesized to be present in the supernatant, but that may not be sufficiently abundant to be observed in single-stage mass spectra, are subjected to multistage MS. Highly specific fragmentation signatures enable unambiguous identification of the peptides of interest and differentiation of the signals from the background. As examples, we demonstrate the rapid (<1 min) determination of the mating type of cells in colonies of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the elucidation of autoinducing peptides (AIPs) from supernatants of pathogenic Staphylococci. We confirm the primary structures of the agrD encoded cyclic AIPs of Staphylococcus aureus for groups I, II, and IV and provide direct evidence that the native group-III AIP is a heptapeptide (INCDFLL). We also show that the homologous peptide from Staphylococcus intermedius is a nonapeptide (RIPTSTGFF) with a lactone ring formed through condensation of the serine side chain with the C terminus of the peptide. This is the first demonstration of cyclization in a staphylococcal AIP that occurs via lactone formation. These examples demonstrate the analytical power of the present procedure for characterizing secreted peptides and its potential utility for identifying microorganisms.},

We generated transgenic mice that overexpress the human disease-associated K8 Gly61-to-Cys (G61C) variant and showed that G61C predisposes to liver injury and apoptosis and dramatically inhibits K8 phosphorylation at serine 73 (S73) via stress-activated kinases. This led us to generate mice that overexpress K8 S73-to-Ala (S73A), which mimicked the susceptibility of K8 G61C mice to injury, thereby providing a molecular link between K8 phosphorylation and disease-associated mutation. Upon apoptotic stimulation, G61C and S73A hepatocytes have persistent and increased nonkeratin proapoptotic substrate phosphorylation by stress-activated kinases, compared with wild-type hepatocytes, in association with an inability to phosphorylate K8 S73. Our findings provide the first direct link between patient-related human keratin variants and liver disease predisposition. The highly abundant cytoskeletal protein K8, and possibly other keratins with the conserved S73-containing phosphoepitope, can protect tissue from injury by serving as a phosphate "sponge" for stress-activated kinases and thereby provide a novel nonmechanical function for intermediate filament proteins.},

A more precise and efficient method, in which previously observed and identified peptide MS/MS spectra are catalogued and condensed into searchable spectral libraries to allow new identifications by spectral matching, is seen as a promising alternative. To that end, an open-source, functionally complete, high-throughput and readily extensible MS/MS spectral searching tool, SpectraST, was developed. A high-quality spectral library was constructed by combining the high-confidence identifications of millions of spectra taken from various data repositories and searched using four sequence search engines. The resulting library consists of over 30,000 spectra for Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using this library, SpectraST vastly outperforms the sequence search engine SEQUEST in terms of speed and the ability to discriminate good and bad hits. A unique advantage of SpectraST is its full integration into the popular Trans Proteomic Pipeline suite of software, which facilitates user adoption and provides important functionalities such as peptide and protein probability assignment, quantification, and data visualization. This method of spectral library searching is especially suited for targeted proteomics applications, offering superior performance to traditional sequence searching.},

The most commonly used reagents are iodoacetic acid and iodoacetamide, which increase the molecular mass of the protein by 58 or 57 Da, respectively, for each derivatized cysteine. A possible side reaction is derivatization of methionine. In our analysis of derivatized human lens alphaA-crystallins, we found an apparent molecular mass 48 Da lower than the mass expected for alphaA-crystallin with the cysteines carboxyamidomethylated. Analysis of a tryptic digest of this protein showed that both cysteines and one methionine had been derivatized. Peaks indicating a molecular mass 48 Da less than expected for the protein with only cysteines derivatized were attributed to fragmentation of the derivatized methionine through collision-induced dissociation in the electrospray ionization source. An awareness of this artifact is important to investigators searching for proteins and their modified forms in complex mixtures.},

Mass spectrometry (MS) is one of the central detection techniques in proteome analysis, yet it has to rely on prior sample preparation steps that reduce the enormous complexity of the protein mixtures obtained from biological systems. For that reason, a number of so-called tagging (or labeling) strategies have been developed that target specific amino acid residues or post-translational modifications, enabling the enrichment of subfractions via affinity clean-up, resulting in the identification of an ever increasing number of proteins. In addition, the attachment of stable-isotope-labeled tags now allows the relative quantitation of protein levels of two samples, e.g. those representing different cell states, which is of great significance for drug discovery and molecular biology. Finally, tagging schemes also serve to facilitate interpretation of MS/MS spectra, therefore assisting in de novo elucidation of protein sequences and automated database searching. This review summarizes the different application fields for tagging strategies for today's MS-based proteome analysis. Advantages and drawbacks of the numerous strategies that have appeared in the literature in the last years are highlighted, and an outlook on emerging tagging techniques is given.},

To evaluate its performance, two sets of LC-ESI-MS/MS data were analyzed by the ASAPRatio algorithm without human intervention, and the data were related to the expected and manually validated values.

For the majority of cases studied, the dominant reaction is a rearrangement process that results in the loss of the C-terminal residue and formation of a product ion that is one amino acid shorter than the original peptide ion. Using the multistage MS/MS capabilities of quadrupole ion trap and ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometers, a subsequent stage of MS/MS can be performed to determine the identity of the new C-terminal residue. Up to eight stage of MS/MS have been performed with both quadrupole ion trap and ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometers. In general, the same dissociation pathways are observed with both instruments, although occasionally there are significant differences in the branching ratios of competing pathways.},

As thousands of spectra are generated by a mass spectrometer in one hour, the speed of database searching is critical, especially when searching against a large sequence database, or when the peptide is generated by some unknown or non-specific enzyme, even or when the target peptides have post-translational modifications (PTM). In practice, about 70-90% of the spectra have no match in the database. Many believe that a significant portion of them are due to peptides of non-specific digestions by unknown enzymes or amino acid modifications. In another case, scientists may choose to use some non-specific enzymes such as pepsin or thermolysin for proteolysis in proteomic study, in that not all proteins are amenable to be digested by some site-specific enzymes, and furthermore many digested peptides may not fall within the rang of molecular weight suitable for mass spectrometry analysis. Interpretating mass spectra of these kinds will cost a lot of computational time of database search engines. Overview: The present study was designed to speed up the database searching process for both cases. More specifically speaking, we employed an approach combining suffix tree data structure and spectrum graph. The suffix tree is used to preprocess the protein sequence database, while the spectrum graph is used to preprocess the tandem mass spectrum. We then search the suffix tree against the spectrum graph for candidate peptides. We design an efficient algorithm to compute a matching threshold with some statistical significance level, e.g. p = 0.01, for each spectrum, and use it to select candidate peptides. Then we rank these peptides using a SEQUEST-like scoring function. The algorithms were implemented and tested on experimental data. For post-translational modifications, we allow arbitrary number of any modification to a protein.

The most common approaches rely on the available databases to match experimental MS/MS data. These methods suffer from several drawbacks and cannot be used for the identification of proteins from unknown genomes.

To assess a match, SEQUEST uses the difference between the first- and second-ranked sequences (ACn). This value is dependent on the database size, search parameters, and sequence homologies. In this report, we demonstrate the use of a scoring routine (SEQUEST-NORM) that normalizes XCorr values to be independent of peptide size and the database used to perform the search.

abstract = "{Large-scale genomics has enabled proteomics by creating sequence infrastructures that can be used with mass spectrometry data to identify proteins. Although protein sequences can be deduced from nucleotide sequences, posttranslational modifications to proteins, in general, cannot. We describe a process for the analysis of posttranslational modifications that is simple, robust, general, and can be applied to complicated protein mixtures. A protein or protein mixture is digested by using three different enzymes: one that cleaves in a site-specific manner and two others that cleave nonspecifically. The mixture of peptides is separated by multidimensional liquid chromatography and analyzed by a tandem mass spectrometer. This approach has been applied to modification analyses of proteins in a simple protein mixture, Cdc2p protein complexes isolated through the use of an affinity tag, and lens tissue from a patient with congenital cataracts. Phosphorylation sites have been detected with known stoichiometry of as low as 10%. Eighteen sites of four different types of modification have been detected on three of the five proteins in a simple mixture, three of which were previously unreported. Three proteins from Cdc2p isolated complexes yielded eight sites containing three different types of modifications. In the lens tissue, 270 proteins were identified, and 11 different crystallins were found to contain a total of 73 sites of modification. Modifications identified in the crystallin proteins included Ser, Thr, and Tyr phosphorylation, Arg and Lys methylation, Lys acetylation, and Met, Tyr, and Trp oxidations.

FASTS searches with peptide sequences of unknown order, as obtained by mass spectrometry-based sequencing, evaluating all possible arrangements of the peptides. FASTF searches with mixed peptide sequences, as generated by Edman sequencing of unseparated mixtures of peptides. FASTF deconvolutes the mixture, using a greedy heuristic that allows rapid identification of high scoring alignments while reducing the total number of explored alternatives. Both algorithms use the heuristic FASTA comparison strategy to accelerate the search but use alignment probability, rather than similarity score, as the criterion for alignment optimality. Statistical estimates are calculated using an empirical correction to a theoretical probability. These calculated estimates were accurate within a factor of 10 for FASTS and 1000 for FASTF on our test dataset. FASTS requires only 15-20 total residues in three or four peptides to robustly identify homologues sharing 50% or greater protein sequence identity. FASTF requires about 25% more sequence data than FASTS for equivalent sensitivity, but additional sequence data are usually available from mixed Edman experiments. Thus, both algorithms can identify homologues that diverged 100 to 500 million years ago, allowing proteomic identification from organisms whose genomes have not been sequenced.}",

abstract = {The high success of the "uncertified" mass spectrometry spectral collection started in 1956 demonstrated qualitatively that a partial reference mass spectrum, even one measured routinely, can be of real value. Correct matchings were still possible despite reference errors, which almost never led to close matches that were incorrect. This study shows quantitatively that the number of different compounds, not the number of peaks in a spectrum, is by far the most important determinant of database efficiency for identifying a "global" unknown. A statistical evaluation of matching performance shows that only 6, 12, and 18 peaks in a reference spectrum are 13%, 67%, and 96%, respectively, as valuable as hundreds of peaks. Also, a separately measured second spectrum of the same compound is 50% as valuable as the first. Database expansion that tripled the number of possible wrong answers only reduced the proportion of correct identifications by 5%. Corrections of a mass or abundance error in each of six reference spectra increase the database matching performance by as much as the addition of one spectrum of a new compound. A new "matching quality index" based statistically on these values indicates that the largest database is also by far the most effective for matching unknowns.},

Particularly using electrospray ionization (ESI), many intact proteins and their proteolytic products harboring post-translational and chemical modifications (PTMs) have been studied by high resolution tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). The widely touted analytical figures of merit for FTMS in fact have translated into clarity when analyzing PTMs from phosphorylations to disulfides, oxidations, methylations, acetylations, and even exotic PTMs found in the biosynthesis of antibiotics and other natural products. A top down approach to PTM detection and localization is proving extensible to an increasing variety of PTMs, some of which are stable to MS/MS at the protein level but unstable to amide bond cleavage by threshold dissociations at the level of small peptides <3 kDa. In contrast, MS/MS using electron capture dissociation (ECD) allows precise localization of even labile PTMs given enough sample and abundant molecular ions. Finally, this brief synopsis of recent literature highlights specific PTMs that perturb the protein backbone therefore altering MS/MS fragmentation patterns. Thus, FTMS will continue its expansion into more laboratories in part because of its ability to detect and deconvolute the regulatory mechanisms of biology written in the language of PTMs.},

abstract = {The IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex, composed of two catalytic subunits (IKKalpha and IKKbeta) and a regulatory subunit (IKKgamma), is the key enzyme in activation of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB). To study the mechanism and structure of the complex, we wanted to recombinantly express IKK in a model organism that lacks IKK. For this purpose, we have recombinantly reconstituted all three subunits together in yeast and have found that it is biochemically similar to IKK isolated from human cells. We show that there is one regulatory subunit per kinase subunit. Thus, the core subunit composition of IKKalpha.beta.gamma complex is alpha(1)beta(1)gamma(2), and the core subunit composition of IKKbeta.gamma is beta(2)gamma(2). The activity of the IKK complex (alpha+beta+gamma or beta+gamma) expressed in yeast (which lack NF-kappaB and IKK) is 4-5-fold higher than an equivalent amount of IKK from nonstimulated HeLa cells. In the absence of IKKgamma, IKKbeta shows a level of activity similar to that of IKK from nonstimulated HeLa cells. Thus, IKKgamma activates IKK complex in the absence of upstream stimuli. Deleting the gamma binding domain of IKKbeta or IKKalpha prevented IKKgamma induced activation of IKK complex in yeast, but it did not prevent the incorporation of IKKgamma into IKK and large complex formation. The possibility of IKK complex being under negative control in mammalian cells is discussed.},

The two primary ways of analyzing MS/MS data are database search and de novo sequencing. In this paper, we present a new approach to peptide de novo sequencing, called MSNovo, which has the following advanced features. (1) It works on data generated from both LCQ and LTQ mass spectrometers and interprets singly, doubly, and triply charged ions. (2) It integrates a new probabilistic scoring function with a mass array-based dynamic programming algorithm. The simplicity of the scoring function, with only 6-10 parameters to be trained, avoids the problem of overfitting and allows MSNovo to be adopted for other machines and data sets easily. The mass array data structure explicitly encodes all possible peptides and allows the dynamic programming algorithm to find the best peptide. (3) Compared to existing programs, MSNovo predicts peptides as well as sequence tags with a higher accuracy, which is important for those applications that search protein databases using the de novo sequencing results. More specifically, we show that MSNovo outperforms other programs on various ESI ion trap data. We also show that for high-resolution data the performance of MSNovo improves significantly.

Approximately half of the components excised from a two-dimensional gel separation of the spliceosome were found in protein sequence databases. Using nanoelectrospray mass spectrometry, the remainder were identified and cloned using public expressed sequence tag (EST) databases. Existing EST databases are thus already sufficiently complete to allow rapid characterization of large mammalian protein complexes via mass spectrometry.}",

title = {Extent of modifications in human proteome samples and their effect on dynamic range of analysis in shotgun proteomics},
abstract = {The complexity of the human proteome, already enormous at the organism level, increases further in the course of the proteome analysis due to in vitro sample evolution. Most of in vitro alterations can also occur in vivo as post-translational modifications. These two types of modifications can only be distinguished a posteriori but not in the process of analysis, thus rendering necessary the analysis of every molecule in the sample. With the new software tool ModifiComb applied to MS/MS data, the extent of modifications was measured in tryptic mixtures representing the full proteome of human cells. The estimated level of 8-12 modified peptides per each unmodified tryptic peptide present at >or=1% level is approaching one modification per amino acid on average. This is a higher modification rate than was previously thought, posing an additional challenge to analytical techniques. The solution to the problem is seen in improving sample preparation routines, introducing dynamic range-adjusted thresholds for database searches, using more specific MS/MS analysis using high mass accuracy and complementary fragmentation techniques, and revealing peptide families with identification of additional proteins only by unfamiliar peptides. Extensive protein separation prior to analysis reduces the requirements on speed and dynamic range of a tandem mass spectrometer and can be a viable alternative to the shotgun approach.},

title = {Improving protein identification using complementary fragmentation techniques in fourier transform mass spectrometry},
abstract = {Identification of proteins by MS/MS is performed by matching experimental mass spectra against calculated spectra of all possible peptides in a protein data base. The search engine assigns each spectrum a score indicating how well the experimental data complies with the expected one; a higher score means increased confidence in the identification. One problem is the false-positive identifications, which arise from incomplete data as well as from the presence of misleading ions in experimental mass spectra due to gas-phase reactions, stray ions, contaminants, and electronic noise. We employed a novel technique of reduction of false positives that is based on a combined use of orthogonal fragmentation techniques electron capture dissociation (ECD) and collisionally activated dissociation (CAD). Since ECD and CAD exhibit many complementary properties, their combined use greatly increased the analysis specificity, which was further strengthened by the high mass accuracy (approximately 1 ppm) afforded by Fourier transform mass spectrometry. The utility of this approach is demonstrated on a whole cell lysate from Escherichia coli. Analysis was made using the data-dependent acquisition mode. Extraction of complementary sequence information was performed prior to data base search using in-house written software. Only masses involved in complementary pairs in the MS/MS spectrum from the same or orthogonal fragmentation techniques were submitted to the data base search. ECD/CAD identified twice as many proteins at a fixed statistically significant confidence level with on average a 64% higher Mascot score. The confidence in protein identification was hereby increased by more than 1 order of magnitude. The combined ECD/CAD searches were on average 20% faster than CAD-only searches. A specially developed test with scrambled MS/MS data revealed that the amount of false-positive identifications was dramatically reduced by the combined use of CAD and ECD.},

abstract = {Sequence verification and mapping of posttranslational modifications require nearly 100% sequence coverage in the "bottom-up" protein analysis. Even in favorable cases, routine liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry detects from protein digests peptides covering 50-90% of the sequence. Here we investigated the reasons for limited peptide detection, considering various physicochemical aspects of peptide behavior in liquid chromatography-Fourier transform mass spectrometry (LC-FTMS). No overall correlation was found between the detection probability and peptide mass. In agreement with literature data, the signal increased with peptide hydrophobicity. Surprisingly, the pI values exhibited an opposite trend, with more acidic tryptic peptides detected with higher probability. A mixture of synthesized peptides of similar masses confirmed the hydrophobicity dependence but showed strong positive correlation between pI and signal response. An explanation of this paradoxal behavior was found through the observation that more acidic tryptic peptide lengths tend to be longer. Longer peptides tend to acquire higher average charge state in positive mode electrospray ionization than more basic but shorter counterparts. The induced-current detection in FTMS favors ions in higher charge states, thus providing the observed pI-FTMS signal anticorrelation.},

Biological macromolecules are the main actors in the makeup of life whether expressed in prospering diversity or in threatening disease. To understand biology and medicine at molecular level where the identity, functional characteristics, structural architecture and specific interactions of biomolecules are the basis of life, we need to visualize the activity and interplay of large macromolecules such as proteins. To study, or analyse, the protein molecules, principles for their separation and determination of their individual characteristics had to be developed.

title = {Improved peptide identification in proteomics by two consecutive stages of mass spectrometric fragmentation},
abstract = {MS-based proteomics usually involves the fragmentation of tryptic peptides (tandem MS or MS(2)) and their identification by searching protein sequence databases. In ion trap instruments fragments can be further fragmented and analyzed, a process termed MS/MS/MS or MS(3). Here, we report that efficient ion capture in a linear ion trap leads to MS(3) acquisition times and spectra quality similar to those for MS(2) experiments with conventional 3D ion traps. Fragmentation of N- or C-terminal ions resulted in informative and low-background spectra, even at subfemtomol levels of peptide. Typically C-terminal ions are chosen for further fragmentation, and the MS(3) spectrum greatly constrains the C-terminal amino acids of the peptide sequence. MS(3) spectra allow resolution of ambiguities in identification, a crucial problem in proteomics. Because of the sensitivity and rapid scan rates of the linear ion trap, several MS(3) spectra per peptide can be obtained even when sequencing very complex mixtures. We calculate the probability that an experimental MS(3) spectrum originates from fragmentation of a given N- or C-terminal ion of a peptide under consideration. This MS(3) identification score can be combined with the MS(2) scores of the precursor peptide from existing search engines. When MS(3) is performed on the linear ion trap-Fourier transform mass spectrometer combination, accurate peptide masses further increase confidence in peptide identification.},

abstract = "{Quantitative proteomics has traditionally been performed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, but recently, mass spectrometric methods based on stable isotope quantitation have shown great promise for the simultaneous and automated identification and quantitation of complex protein mixtures. Here we describe a method, termed SILAC, for stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture, for the in vivo incorporation of specific amino acids into all mammalian proteins. Mammalian cell lines are grown in media lacking a standard essential amino acid but supplemented with a non-radioactive, isotopically labeled form of that amino acid, in this case deuterated leucine (Leu-d3). We find that growth of cells maintained in these media is no different from growth in normal media as evidenced by cell morphology, doubling time, and ability to differentiate. Complete incorporation of Leu-d3 occurred after five doublings in the cell lines and proteins studied. Protein populations from experimental and control samples are mixed directly after harvesting, and mass spectrometric identification is straightforward as every leucine-containing peptide incorporates either all normal leucine or all Leu-d3. We have applied this technique to the relative quantitation of changes in protein expression during the process of muscle cell differentiation. Proteins that were found to be up-regulated during this process include glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, fibronectin, and pyruvate kinase M2. SILAC is a simple, inexpensive, and accurate procedure that can be used as a quantitative proteomic approach in any cell culture system.}",

Unstructured regions of proteins play an important role in this problem and considerable advantage can be gained in removing them. We have developed a number of enhancements to amide hydrogen/high-throughput and high-resolution deuterium exchange MS (DXMS) technology that allow rapid identification of unstructured regions in proteins. To demonstrate the utility of this approach for improving crystallization success, DXMS analysis was attempted on 24 Thermotoga maritima proteins with varying crystallization and diffraction characteristics. Data acquisition and analysis for 21 of these proteins was completed in 2 weeks and resulted in the localization and prediction of several unstructured regions within the proteins. When compared with those targets of known structure, the DXMS method correctly localized even small regions of disorder. DXMS analysis was then correlated with the propensity of such targets to crystallize and was further used to define truncations that improved crystallization. Truncations that were defined solely on DXMS analysis demonstrated greatly improved crystallization and have been used for structure determination. This approach represents a rapid and generalized method that can be applied to structural genomics or other targets in a high-throughput manner.}",

abstract = "{Although protein identification by matching tandem mass spectra (MS/MS) against protein databases is a widespread tool in mass spectrometry, the question about reliability of such searches remains open. Absence of rigorous significance scores in MS/MS database search makes it difficult to discard random database hits and may lead to erroneous protein identification, particularly in the case of mutated or post-translationally modified peptides. This problem is especially important for high-throughput MS/MS projects when the possibility of expert analysis is limited. Thus, algorithms that sort out reliable database hits from unreliable ones and identify mutated and modified peptides are sought. Most MS/MS database search algorithms rely on variations of the Shared Peaks Count approach that scores pairs of spectra by the peaks (masses) they have in common. Although this approach proved to be useful, it has a high error rate in identification of mutated and modified peptides. We describe new MS/MS database search tools, MS-CONVOLUTION and MS-ALIGNMENT, which implement the spectral convolution and spectral alignment approaches to peptide identification. We further analyze these approaches to identification of modified peptides and demonstrate their advantages over the Shared Peaks Count. We also use the spectral alignment approach as a filter in a new database search algorithm that reliably identifies peptides differing by up to two mutations/modifications from a peptide in a database.}",

De novo sequencing identifies peptide directly from tandem mass spectra. Among many proposed algorithms, we evaluated the performance of the five de novo sequencing algorithms, AUDENS, Lutefisk, NovoHMM, PepNovo, and PEAKS. Our evaluation methods are based on calculation of relative sequence distance (RSD), algorithm sensitivity, and spectrum quality. We found that de novo sequencing algorithms have different performance in analyzing QSTAR and LCQ mass spectrometer data, but in general, perform better in analyzing QSTAR data than LCQ data. For the QSTAR data, the performance order of the five algorithms is PEAKS > Lutefisk, PepNovo > AUDENS, NovoHMM. The performance of PEAKS, Lutefisk, and PepNovo strongly depends on the spectrum quality and increases with an increase of spectrum quality. However, AUDENS and NovoHMM are not sensitive to the spectrum quality. Compared with other four algorithms, PEAKS has the best sensitivity and also has the best performance in the entire range of spectrum quality. For the LCQ data, the performance order is NovoHMM > PepNovo, PEAKS > Lutefisk > AUDENS. NovoHMM has the best sensitivity, and its performance is the best in the entire range of spectrum quality. But the overall performance of NovoHMM is not significantly different from the performance of PEAKS and PepNovo. AUDENS does not give a good performance in analyzing either QSTAR and LCQ data.},

A., Schutz, F., Reid, G. E., Eddes, J. S., Moritz, R. L., O'Hair, R. A. J., Speed, T. P. and Simpson, R. J. Anal. Chem. 2003, 75, 6251-6264.]. Here, we have reexamined this database in order to determine the effect of a common post-translational or process induced modification, methionine oxidation, on the appearance and relative abundances of the product ions formed by low energy collision induced dissociation of peptide ions containing this modification. The results from this study indicate that the structurally diagnostic neutral loss of methane sulfenic acid (CH3SOH, 64Da) from the side chain of methionine sulfoxide residues is the dominant fragmentation process for methionine sulfoxide containing peptide ions under conditions of low proton mobility, i.e., when ionizing proton(s) are sequestered at strongly basic amino acids such as arginine, lysine or histidine. The product ion abundances resulting from this neutral loss were found to be approximately 2-fold greater than those resulting from the cleavage C-terminal to aspartic acid, which has previously been shown to be enhanced under the same conditions. In close agreement with these statistical trends, experimental and theoretical studies, employing synthetic "tryptic" peptides and model methionine sulfoxide containing peptide ions, have determined that the mechanism for enhanced methionine sulfoxide side chain cleavage proceeds primarily via a 'charge remote' process. However, the mechanism for dissociation of the side chain for these ions was observed to change as a function of proton mobility. Finally, the transition state barrier for the charge remote side chain cleavage mechanism is predicted to be energetically more favorable than that for charge remote cleavage C-terminal to aspartic acid.},

abstract = "{We report the results of our work to facilitate protein identification using tandem mass spectra and protein sequence databases. We describe a parallel version of SEQUEST (SEQUEST-PVM) that is tolerant toward arithmetic exceptions. The changes we report effectively separate search processes on slave nodes from each other. Therefore, if one of the slave nodes drops out of the cluster due to an error, the rest of the cluster will carry the search process to the end. SEQUEST has been widely used for protein identifications. The modifications made to the code improve its stability and effectiveness in a high-throughput production environment. We evaluate the overhead associated with the parallelization of SEQUEST. A prior version of software to preprocess LC/MS/MS data attempted to differentiate the charge states of ions. Singly charged ions can be accurately identified, but the software was unable to reliably differentiate tandem mass spectra of +2 and +3 charge states. We have designed and implemented a computational approach to narrow charge states of precursor ions from nominal resolution ion-trap tandem mass spectra. The preprocessing code, 2to3, determines the charge state of the precursor ion using its mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) and fragment ions contained in the tandem mass spectrum. For each possible charge state the program calculates the expected fragment ions that account for precursor ion m/z values. If any one of the numbers is less than an empirically determined threshold value then the spectrum corresponding to that charge state is removed. If both numbers are higher than the threshold value then +2 and +3 copies of the spectrum are kept. We present the comparison of results from protein identification experiments with and without using 2 to 3. It is shown that by determining the charge state and eliminating poor quality spectra 2to3 decreases the number of spectral files to be searched without affecting the search results. The decrease reduces computer requirements and researcher efforts for analysis of the results.}",

The method employs a hypergeometric distribution to model frequencies of matches between fragment ions predicted for peptide sequences with a specific (M + H)+ value (at some mass tolerance) in a protein sequence database and an experimental tandem mass spectrum. The hypergeometric distribution constitutes null hypothesis-all peptide matches to a tandem mass spectrum are random. It is used to generate a score characterizing the randomness of a database sequence match to an experimental tandem mass spectrum and to determine the level of significance of the null hypothesis. For each tandem mass spectrum and database search, a peptide is identified that has the least probability of being a random match to the spectrum and the corresponding level of significance of the null hypothesis is determined. To check the validity of the hypergeometric model in describing fragment ion matches, we used chi2 test. The distribution of frequencies and corresponding hypergeometric probabilities are generated for each tandem mass spectrum. No proteolytic cleavage specificity is used to create the peptide sequences from the database. We do not use any empirical probabilities in this method. The scores generated by the hypergeometric model do not have a significant molecular weight bias and are reasonably independent of database size. The approach has been implemented in a database search algorithm, PEP_PROBE. By using a large set of tandem mass spectra derived from a set of peptides created by digestion of a collection of known proteins using four different proteases, a false positive rate of 5% is demonstrated.}",

abstract = {The Mascot score (M-score) is one of the conventional validity measures in data base identification of peptides and proteins by MS/MS data. Although tremendously useful, M-score has a number of limitations. For the same MS/MS data, M-score may change if the protein data base is expanded. A low M-value may not necessarily mean poor match but rather poor MS/MS quality. In addition M-score does not fully utilize the advantage of combined use of complementary fragmentation techniques collisionally activated dissociation (CAD) and electron capture dissociation (ECD). To address these issues, a new data base-independent scoring method (S-score) was designed that is based on the maximum length of the peptide sequence tag provided by the combined CAD and ECD data. The quality of MS/MS spectra assessed by S-score allows poor data (39% of all MS/MS spectra) to be filtered out before the data base search, speeding up the data analysis and eliminating a major source of false positive identifications. Spectra with below threshold M-scores (poor matches) but high S-scores are validated. Spectra with zero M-score (no data base match) but high S-score are classified as belonging to modified sequences. As an extension of S-score, an extremely reliable sequence tag was developed based on complementary fragments simultaneously appearing in CAD and ECD spectra. Comparison of this tag with the data base-derived sequence gives the most reliable peptide identification validation to date. The combined use of M- and S-scoring provides positive sequence identification from >25% of all MS/MS data, a 40% improvement over traditional M-scoring performed on the same Fourier transform MS instrumentation. The number of proteins reliably identified from Escherichia coli cell lysate hereby increased by 29% compared with the traditional M-score approach. Finally S-scoring provides a quantitative measure of the quality of fragmentation techniques such as the minimum abundance of the precursor ion, the MS/MS of which gives the threshold S-score value of 2.},

title = {Proteomics-grade de novo sequencing approach},
abstract = {The conventional approach in modern proteomics to identify proteins from limited information provided by molecular and fragment masses of their enzymatic degradation products carries an inherent risk of both false positive and false negative identifications. For reliable identification of even known proteins, complete de novo sequencing of their peptides is desired. The main problems of conventional sequencing based on tandem mass spectrometry are incomplete backbone fragmentation and the frequent overlap of fragment masses. In this work, the first proteomics-grade de novo approach is presented, where the above problems are alleviated by the use of complementary fragmentation techniques CAD and ECD. Implementation of a high-current, large-area dispenser cathode as a source of low-energy electrons provided efficient ECD of doubly charged peptides, the most abundant species (65-80%), in a typical trypsin-based proteomics experiment. A new linear de novo algorithm is developed combining efficiency and speed, processing on a conventional 3 GHz PC, 1000 MS/MS data sets in 60 s. More than 6% of all MS/MS data for doubly charged peptides yielded complete sequences, and another 13% gave nearly complete sequences with a maximum gap of two amino acid residues. These figures are comparable with the typical success rates (5-15%) of database identification. For peptides reliably found in the database (Mowse score > or = 34), the agreement with de novo-derived full sequences was >95%. Full sequences were derived in 67% of the cases when full sequence information was present in MS/MS spectra. Thus the new de novo sequencing approach reached the same level of efficiency and reliability as conventional database-identification strategies.},

Here we present a fast and reliable method ("ModifiComb") for mapping hundreds types of PTMs at a time, including novel and unexpected PTMs. The high mass accuracy of Fourier transform mass spectrometry provides in many cases unique elemental composition of the PTM through the difference DeltaM between the molecular masses of the modified and unmodified peptides, whereas the retention time difference DeltaRT between their elution in reversed-phase liquid chromatography provides an additional dimension for PTM identification. Abundant sequence information obtained with complementary fragmentation techniques using ion-neutral collisions and electron capture often locates the modification to a single residue. The (DeltaM, DeltaRT) maps are representative of the proteome and its overall modification state and may be used for database-independent organism identification, comparative proteomic studies, and biomarker discovery.

title = {'Top-down' characterization of site-directed mutagenesis products of Staphylococcus aureus dihydroneopterin aldolase by multistage tandem mass spectrometry in a linear quadrupole ion trap},
abstract = {The gas-phase fragmentation reactions of a series of site-directed mutagenesis products of Staphylococcus aureus dihydroneopterin aldolase have been examined by multistage tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS and MS(3)) in a linear quadrupole ion trap in order to explore the utility of this instrumentation for routine 'top-down' recombinant protein characterization. Following a rapid low resolution survey of the fragmentation behavior of the precursor ions from the wild type (WT) protein, selected charge states were subjected to detailed structural characterization by using high resolution 'zoom' and 'ultrazoom' resonance ejection MS/MS product ion scans. Dissociation of the [M + 18H](18+) charge state yielded a range of product ions from which extensive sequence information could be derived. In contrast, dissociation of the [M + 20H](20+) charge state resulted in a single dominant y(96) product ion formed by fragmentation between adjacent Ile/Gly residues, with only limited sequence coverage. Further extensive sequence information was readily obtained however, by MS(3) dissociation of this initial product. From the combined MS/MS and MS(3) spectra an overall sequence coverage of 66.9%, with fragmentation of 85 of the 127 amide bonds within the WT protein, was obtained. MS/MS and MS(3) of three of the four site-directed mutagenesis products (E29A), (Y61F) and (E81A) were found to yield essentially identical product ion spectra to the WT protein, indicating that these modifications had no significant influence on the fragmentation behavior. The specific site of modification could be unambiguously determined in each case by characterization of product ions resulting from fragmentation of amide bonds on either side of the mutation site. In contrast, MS/MS and MS(3) of the K107A mutant led to significantly different product ion spectra dominated by cleavages occurring N-terminal to proline, which restricted the ability to localize the modification site to within only an 8 amino acid region of the sequence. This work highlights the need for further studies to characterize the charge state, sequence and structural dependence to the low energy collision induced dissociation reactions of multiply protonated intact protein ions.},

title = "{Patchwork peptide sequencing: extraction of sequence information from accurate mass data of peptide tandem mass spectra recorded at high resolution}",
abstract = "{The accurate mass values of all immonium, y(1), y(2), a(2), and b(2) ions of tryptic peptides composed of the 20 standard amino acids were calculated. The differences between adjacent masses in this data set are greater than 10 mDa for more than 80% of the values. Using this mass list, the majority of low mass ions in quadrupole-time of flight tandem mass spectra of peptides from tryptic digests and from an elastase digest could be assigned. Besides the a(2)/b(2) ions, which carry residues 1-2 from the N-terminus, a variety of internal dipeptide b ions were regularly observed. In case internal proline was present, corresponding dipeptide b ions carrying proline at the N-terminal position occurred. By assigning the dipeptide b ions on the basis of their accurate mass, bidirectional or unidirectional sequence information was obtained, which is localized to the peptide N-terminus (a(2)/b(2) ions) or not localized (internal b ions). Identification of the y(1) and y(2) ions by their accurate mass provides unidirectional sequence information localized to the peptide C-terminus. It is shown that this patchwork-type sequence information extractable from accurate mass data of low-mass ions is highly efficient for protein identification.}",

abstract = "{With the increasing availability of de novo sequencing algorithms for interpreting high-mass accuracy tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data, there is a growing need for programs that accurately identify proteins from de novo sequencing results. De novo sequences derived from tandem mass spectra of peptides often contain ambiguous regions where the exact amino acid order cannot be determined. One problem this poses for sequence alignment algorithms is the difficulty in distinguishing discrepancies due to de novo sequencing errors from actual genomic sequence variation and posttranslational modifications. We present a novel, mass-based approach to sequence alignment, implemented as a program called OpenSea, to resolve these problems. In this approach, de novo and database sequences are interpreted as masses of residues, and the masses, rather than the amino acid codes, are compared. To provide further flexibility, the masses can be aligned in groups, which can resolve many de novo sequencing errors. The performance of OpenSea was tested with three types of data: a mixture of known proteins, a mixture of unknown proteins that commonly contain sequence variations, and a mixture of posttranslationally modified known proteins. In all three cases, we demonstrate that OpenSea can identify more peptides and proteins than commonly used database-searching programs (SEQUEST and ProteinLynx) while accurately locating sequence variation sites and unanticipated posttranslational modifications in a high-throughput environment.}",

abstract = {Protein microanalysis usually involves the sequencing of gel-separated proteins available in very small amounts. While mass spectrometry has become the method of choice for identifying proteins in databases, in almost all laboratories 'de novo' protein sequencing is still performed by Edman degradation. Here we show that a combination of the nanoelectrospray ion source, isotopic end labeling of peptides and a quadrupole/ time-of-flight instrument allows facile read-out of the sequences of tryptic peptides. Isotopic labeling was performed by enzymatic digestion of proteins in 1:1 16O/18O water, eliminating the need for peptide derivatization. A quadrupole/time-of-flight mass spectrometer was constructed from a triple quadrupole and an electrospray time-of-flight instrument. Tandem mass spectra of peptides were obtained with better than 50 ppm mass accuracy and resolution routinely in excess of 5000. Unique and error tolerant identification of yeast proteins as well as the sequencing of a novel protein illustrate the potential of the approach. The high data quality in tandem mass spectra and the additional information provided by the isotopic end labeling of peptides enabled automated interpretation of the spectra via simple software algorithms. The technique demonstrated here removes one of the last obstacles to routine and high throughput protein sequencing by mass spectrometry.},

The following features are incorporated in the algorithm. The members of the set of sequence ions are represented by all possible combinations of N- and C-terminal fragment ions. From the known N- and C-terminating groups and molecular weight (MW) of the peptide, the sequence ions are mathematically re-expressed as N-terminal residue ions and arranged in ascending order. The peptide sequence is computed, in a stepwise iterative procedure, from the mass differences between the mathematically re-expressed N-terminal residue ions and the predicted peptide subsequences for the neighboring ions of lower mass. These mass differences correspond to combinations of known amino acid residues which have previously been computed and tabulated, based upon the FAB fragmentation rules for peptides. The algorithm was successfully applied to sequence the following peptides from their respective FAB or FAB tandem mass spectrum: decapeptyl (MW 1310), angiotensin II (MW 1045), and two 'unknown' peptides (MW 1227 and 1485, respectively). Two criteria used to predict the correct peptide sequence from among many possibilities are the minimum number of amino acid residues and the maximum fragmentation probability per amino acid residue.}",

abstract = {Closely related to studying the function of a protein is the analysis of its three-dimensional structure and the identification of interaction sites with its binding partners. An alternative approach to the high-resolution methods for three-dimensional protein structure analysis, such as X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy, consists of covalently connecting two functional groups of the protein(s) under investigation. The location of the created cross-links imposes a distance constraint on the location of the respective side chains and allows one to draw conclusions on the three-dimensional structure of the protein or a protein complex. Recently, chemical cross-linking of proteins has been combined with a mass spectrometric analysis of the created cross-linked products. This review article describes the most popular cross-linking reagents for protein structure analysis and gives an overview of the different available strategies that employ chemical cross-linking and different mass spectrometric techniques. The challenges for mass spectrometry caused by the enormous complexity of the cross-linking reaction mixtures are emphasized. The various approaches described in the literature to facilitate the mass spectrometric detection of cross-linked products as well as computer software for data analyses are reviewed.},

abstract = "{A new strategy is described for the determination of amino acid sequences of unknown peptides. Different from the well-known but often inefficient de novo sequencing approach, the new method is based on a two-step process. In the first step the amino acid composition of an unknown peptide is determined on the basis of accurate mass values of the peptide precursor ion and a small number of accurate fragment ion mass values, and, as in de novo sequencing, without employing protein database information or other pre-information. In the second step the sequence of the found amino acids of the peptide is determined by scoring the agreement between expected and observed fragment ion signals of the permuted sequences. It was found that the new approach is highly efficient if accurate mass values are available and that it easily outstrips common approaches of de novo sequencing being based on lower accuracies and detailed knowledge of fragmentation behavior. Simple permutation and calculation of all possible amino acid sequences, however, is only efficient if the composition is known or if possible compositions are at least reduced to a small list. The latter requires the highest possible instrumental mass accuracy, which is currently provided only by fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry. The connection between mass accuracy and peptide composition variability is described and an example of peptide compositioning and composition-based sequencing is presented.}",

To identify proteins from organisms with unsequenced genomes, database sequences from related species must be employed for sequence-similarity protein identifications. Peptide sequence tags (Mann, 1994) have been used successfully for the identification of proteins in sequence databases using partially interpreted tandem mass spectra of tryptic peptides. We have extended the ability of sequence tag searching to the identification of proteins whose sequences are yet unknown but are homologous to known database entries. The MultiTag method presented here assigns statistical significance to matches of multiple error-tolerant sequence tags to a database entry and ranks alignments by their significance. The MultiTag approach has the distinct advantage over other sequence-similarity approaches of being able to perform sequence-similarity identifications using only very short (2-4) amino acid residue stretches of peptide sequences, rather than complete peptide sequences deduced by de novo interpretation of tandem mass spectra. This feature facilitates the identification of low abundance proteins, since noisy and low-intensity tandem mass spectra can be utilized.}",

An examination of 1465 ion trap spectra from doubly charged tryptic peptides reveals several trends important to understanding this fragmentation process. While less abundant than y ions, b ions are present in sufficient numbers to aid sequencing algorithms. Fragment ions exhibit a characteristic series-specific relationship between their masses and intensities. Each residue influences fragmentation at adjacent amide bonds, with Pro quantifiably enhancing cleavage at its N-terminal amide bond and His increasing the formation of b ions at its C-terminal amide bond.

abstract = {Tryptophan-derived UV filters (kynurenine and 3-hydroxylkynurenine glucoside) have recently been shown to bind to human lens proteins. These UV filter adducts increase in amount with age and appear to be mainly responsible for the yellowing of the lens in man. On the basis of research performed in other tissues, it has been assumed that indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) may be the first and probably rate-limiting enzyme in UV filter biosynthesis. In this study, 25 human lenses were examined by a reliable and sensitive assay method with a monoclonal antibody specific for IDO. IDO activity was detected in all lenses ranging from 26 to 80 years, and there was no clear relationship of IDO activity with age. The mean activity was 0.85 + 0.49 nmol of kynurenine/h/lens. The level in the iris/ciliary body was negligible (<0.05 nmol of kynurenine/h). The lens IDO activity is consistent with UV filter turnover values obtained previously. These findings indicate that IDO is the first enzyme in the UV filter pathway and that UV filter biosynthesis is active even in aged lenses. Yellowing of the aged lens may therefore be preventable by drug-induced suppression of IDO activity.},

title = "{Implementation and uses of automated de novo peptide sequencing by tandem mass spectrometry}",
abstract = "{There are several computer programs that can match peptide tandem mass spectrometry data to their exactly corresponding database sequences, and in most protein identification projects, these programs are utilized in the early stages of data interpretation. However, situations frequently arise where tandem mass spectral data cannot be correlated with any database sequences. In these cases, the unmatched data could be due to peptides derived from novel proteins, allelic or species-derived variants of known proteins, or posttranslational or chemical modifications. Two additional problems are frequently encountered in high-throughput protein identification. First, it is difficult to quickly sift through large amounts of data to identify those spectra that, due to poor signal or contaminants, can be ignored. Second, it is important to find incorrect database matches (false positives). We have chosen to address these difficulties by performing automatic de novo sequencing using a computer program called Lutefisk. Sequence candidates obtained are used as input in a homology-based database search program called CIDentify to identify variants of known proteins. Comparison of database-derived sequences with de novo sequences allows for electronic validation of database matches even if the latter are not completely correct. Modifications to the original Lutefisk program have been implemented to handle data obtained from triple quadrupole, ion trap, and quadrupole/time-of-flight hybrid (Qtof) mass spectrometers. For example, the linearity of mass errors due to temperature-dependent expansion of the flight tube in a Qtof was exploited such that isobaric amino acids (glutamine/lysine and oxidized methionine/ phenylalanine) can be differentiated without careful attention to mass calibration.}",

abstract = "{A method is described for searching protein sequence databases using tandem mass spectra of tryptic peptides. The approach uses a de novo sequencing algorithm to derive a short list of possible sequence candidates which serve as query sequences in a subsequent homology-based database search routine. The sequencing algorithm employs a graph theory approach similar to previously described sequencing programs. In addition, amino acid composition, peptide sequence tags and incomplete or ambiguous Edman sequence data can be used to aid in the sequence determinations. Although sequencing of peptides from tandem mass spectra is possible, one of the frequently encountered difficulties is that several alternative sequences can be deduced from one spectrum. Most of the alternative sequences, however, are sufficiently similar for a homology-based sequence database search to be possible. Unfortunately, the available protein sequence database search algorithms (e.g. Blast or FASTA) require a single unambiguous sequence as input. Here we describe how the publicly available FASTA computer program was modified in order to search protein databases more effectively in spite of the ambiguities intrinsic in de novo peptide sequencing algorithms.}",

abstract = {Most tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) database search algorithms perform a restrictive search that takes into account only a few types of post-translational modifications (PTMs) and ignores all others. We describe an unrestrictive PTM search algorithm, MS-Alignment, that searches for all types of PTMs at once in a blind mode, that is, without knowing which PTMs exist in nature. Blind PTM identification makes it possible to study the extent and frequency of different types of PTMs, still an open problem in proteomics. Application of this approach to lens proteins resulted in the largest set of PTMs reported in human crystallins so far. Our analysis of various MS/MS data sets implies that the biological phenomenon of modification is much more widespread than previously thought. We also argue that MS-Alignment reveals some uncharacterized modifications that warrant further experimental validation.},

At the heart of this technology is the ability to reproducibly acquire high-quality tandem mass spectra for database interrogation. The variability in tandem mass spectra generation is often assumed to be minimal, and peptide identifications are typically based on a single tandem mass spectrum. In this paper, we characterize the variance of scores derived from replicate tandem mass spectra using several database search algorithms and demonstrate the effects of spectral variability on the correct identification of peptides. We show that the variance associated with the collection of tandem mass spectra can be substantial leading to sizable errors in search algorithm scores ( approximately 5-25% RSD) and ultimately incorrect assignments. Processing strategies are discussed to minimize the impact of tandem mass spectra variability on peptide identification.}",

Here we applied the isotope-coded affinity tag (ICAT) approach to quantitative protein profiling, in this case proteins that copurified with lipid raft plasma membrane domains isolated from control and stimulated Jurkat human T cells. With the ICAT approach, cysteine residues of the two related protein isolates were covalently labeled with isotopically normal and heavy versions of the same reagent, respectively. Following proteolytic cleavage of combined labeled proteins, peptides were fractionated by multidimensional chromatography and subsequently analyzed via automated tandem mass spectrometry. Individual tandem mass spectrometry spectra were searched against a human sequence database, and a variety of recently developed, publicly available software applications were used to sort, filter, analyze, and compare the results of two repetitions of the same experiment. In particular, robust statistical modeling algorithms were used to assign measures of confidence to both peptide sequences and the proteins from which they were likely derived, identified via the database searches. We show that by applying such statistical tools to the identification of T cell lipid raft-associated proteins, we were able to estimate the accuracy of peptide and protein identifications made. These tools also allow for determination of the false positive rate as a function of user-defined data filtering parameters, thus giving the user significant control over and information about the final output of large-scale proteomic experiments. With the ability to assign probabilities to all identifications, the need for manual verification of results is substantially reduced, thus making the rapid evaluation of large proteomic datasets possible. Finally, by repeating the experiment, information relating to the general reproducibility and validity of this approach to large-scale proteomic analyses was also obtained.}",

title = {Tryptophan deficiency arrests chromatin breakdown in secondary lens fibers of rats},
abstract = {Tryptophan deficiency is known for long time to cause cataract in rats. However, up till now the underlying mechanism is still enigmatic. Histological studies showed an extended lens bow suggesting that the normal breakdown of nuclei in the lens fibres is arrested under these conditions. Using advanced ultrastructural techniques we aimed to clarify this aberrant final differentiation of lens fibres. Albino and pigmented rats were permanently or intermittently raised on a tryptophan deficient diet for 12 and 16 weeks, respectively. Rats of the same age raised on a normal diet served as controls. Lenses were treated for light and electron microscopy. For histology sections were stained for DNA and gamma-crystallins. In addition to routine transmission electron microscopy (TEM), ultrathin sections were subjected to electron tomography and energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis (EDX). Histology verified the extended lens bow for albino and pigmented rats and showed that in the intermittent period of normal diet the fibre nuclei are broken down as in controls. It was further shown that gamma-crystallins are co-localized with DNA in the nuclear domain. TEM revealed that during final differentiation nuclear chromatin becomes highly compacted in a chromosome-like manner and than rapidly evanesces in control rats. This compacted stage persists indefinitely in the tryptophan deficient rats. Electron tomography showed that during differentiation chromatin is first uncoiled to 30 nm solenoids, subsequently to highly compacted 10 nm beads-on-a-string fibrils and than is segregated from the nuclear proteins. EDX revealed that the late stage persisting nuclei consist of domains rich in DNA associated with histones and in domains with mainly proteins. This study corroborates previous findings on the final breakdown of nuclei of lens fibres. It further shows that the chromatin is ultimately uncoiled to beads-on-a-string fibrils and that as the last step chromatin is broken down at this unmasked stage. Except for this last step nuclear breakdown is identical in control and tryptophan deficient rats suggesting that it is not the availability of tryptophan for protein synthesis in general which causes the arrest. Two alternatives for this final arrest are discussed. A low tryptophan content, most pronounced in deeper cortical layers, may inhibit the late synthesis of the DNases and proteases necessary for chromatin breakdown. The radical scavenging by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, which cleaves the pyrrole ring of tryptophan to form formylkynurenine using free oxygen radicals, is impaired by low levels of tryptophan. This decreased scavenging of oxygen radicals will expose the catalytic enzymes for chromatin breakdown, residing in the nucleus in an inactive form for quite a long period, to high levels of oxygen radicals and may affect the activity of these enzymes and therefore the execution of the chromatin breakdown.},

Scanning electron micrographs of spores before and after acid extraction show that the spores retain their overall structure but have a shriveled texture following the acid treatment. Extracted SASPs were purified by high-performance liquid chromatography and molecular masses of the SASPs were identified at 7068 (SASP-1), 7332 (SASP-2), and 8889 (gamma-SASP). De novo peptide sequencing was used to determine the protein sequences. The correct ordering of peptide sequences was aided by mapping overlapping enzymatic digests and by comparison with homologous SASPs from Bacillus stearothermophilus. B. globigii is used in many field tests as a surrogate for B. anthracis. Thus complete SASP sequences from B. globigii will facilitate the development of methods for rapid identification of bacteria based on mass spectrometry and the examination of taxonomic relationships between Bacillus species.},

abstract = {We have employed recently developed blind modification search techniques to generate the most comprehensive map of post-translational modifications (PTMs) in human lens constructed to date. Three aged lenses, two of which had moderate cataract, and one young control lens were analyzed using multidimensional liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. In total, 491 modification sites in lens proteins were identified. There were 155 in vivo PTM sites in crystallins: 77 previously reported sites and 78 newly detected PTM sites. Several of these sites had modifications previously undetected by mass spectrometry in lens including carboxymethyl lysine (+58 Da), carboxyethyl lysine (+72 Da), and an arginine modification of +55 Da with yet unknown chemical structure. These new modifications were observed in all three aged lenses but were not found in the young lens. Several new sites of cysteine methylation were identified indicating this modification is more extensive in lens than previously thought. The results were used to estimate the extent of modification at specific sites by spectral counting. We tested the long-standing hypothesis that PTMs contribute to age-related loss of crystallin solubility by comparing spectral counts between the water-soluble and water-insoluble fractions of the aged lenses and found that the extent of deamidation was significantly increased in the water-insoluble fractions. On the basis of spectral counting, the most abundant PTMs in aged lenses were deamidations and methylated cysteines with other PTMs present at lower levels.},

Despite this promise, the methodology has remained labor-intensive and time consuming, with substantial limitations in comprehensiveness (the extent to which target protein sequence is covered with measurable peptide fragments) and resolution (the degree to which exchange measurements can be ascribed to particular amides). I have developed and integrated a number of improvements to these methodologies into an automated high throughput, high resolution system termed Deuterium Exchange Mass Spectrometry (DXMS). With DXMS, complete sequence coverage and single-amide (amino acid) resolution are now rapidly accomplished.

title = {Transformation and other factors of the peptide mass spectrometry pairwise peak-list comparison process},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Biological Mass Spectrometry is used to analyse peptides and proteins. A mass spectrum generates a list of measured mass to charge ratios and intensities of ionised peptides, which is called a peak-list. In order to classify the underlying amino acid sequence, the acquired spectra are usually compared with synthetic ones. Development of suitable methods of direct peak-list comparison may be advantageous for many applications. RESULTS: The pairwise peak-list comparison is a multistage process composed of matching of peaks embedded in two peak-lists, normalisation, scaling of peak intensities and dissimilarity measures. In our analysis, we focused on binary and intensity based measures. We have modified the measures in order to comprise the mass spectrometry specific properties of mass measurement accuracy and non-matching peaks. We compared the labelling of peak-list pairs, obtained using different factors of the pairwise peak-list comparison, as being the same or different to those determined by sequence database searches. In order to elucidate how these factors influence the peak-list comparison we adopted an analysis of variance type method with the partial area under the ROC curve as a dependent variable. CONCLUSION: The analysis of variance provides insight into the relevance of various factors influencing the outcome of the pairwise peak-list comparison. For large MS/MS and PMF data sets the outcome of ANOVA analysis was consistent, providing a strong indication that the results presented here might be valid for many various types of peptide mass measurements.},

abstract = "{Previous studies on the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) identified a conserved interaction pair comprised of Tyr204 from the P+1 loop and Glu230 at the end of the alphaF-helix. Single-point mutations of Tyr204 to Ala (Y204A) and Glu230 to Gln (E230Q) both resulted in alterations in enzymatic kinetics. To understand further the molecular basis for the altered kinetics and the structural role of each residue, we analyzed the Y204A and the E230Q mutants using hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange coupled with mass spectrometry and other biophysical techniques. The fact that the mutants exhibit distinct molecular properties, supports previous hypotheses that these two residues, although in the same interaction node, contribute to the same enzymatic functions through different molecular pathways. The Tyr204 mutation appears to affect the dynamic properties, while the Glu230 mutation affects the surface electrostatic profile of the enzyme. Furthermore, H/D exchange analysis defines the dynamic allosteric range of Tyr204 to include the catalytic loop and three additional distant surface regions, which exhibit increased deuterium exchange in the Y204A but not the E230Q mutant. Interestingly, these are the exact regions that previously showed decreased deuterium exchange upon binding of the RIalpha regulatory subunit of PKA. We propose that these sites, coupled with the P+1 loop through Tyr204, represent one of the major allosteric networks in the kinase. This coupling provides a coordinated response for substrate binding and enzyme catalysis. H/D exchange analysis also further defines the stable core of the catalytic subunit to include the alphaE, alphaF and alphaH-helix. All these observations lead to an interesting new way to view the structural architecture and allosteric conformational regulation of the protein kinase molecule.}",

The search method considers each putative modification site as both modified and unmodified in one pass through the database and simultaneously considers up to three different sites of modification. The search method will identify the correct sequence if the tandem mass spectrum did not represent a modified peptide. This approach is demonstrated with peptides containing modifications such as S-carboxymethylated cysteine, oxidized methionine, phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, or phosphotyrosine. In addition, a scanning approach is used in which neutral loss scans are used to initiate the acquisition of product ion MS/MS spectra of doubly charged phosphorylated peptides during a single chromatographic run for data analysis with the database-searching algorithm. The approach described in this paper provides a convenient method to match the nascent tandem mass spectra of modified peptides to sequences in a protein database and thereby identify previously unknown sites of modification.}",

title = {Method to compare collision-induced dissociation spectra of peptides: potential for library searching and subtractive analysis},
abstract = {We report the development of a method to compare collision-induced dissociation (CID) spectra of peptides. This method employs a cross-correlation analysis of a CID spectrum to a reference spectrum and normalizes the cross-correlation score to the autocorrelation of the CID spectra. The query spectrum is compared by using both mass information and fragmentation patterns. Fragmentation patterns are compared to each other using a correlation function. To evaluate the specificity of the approach, a set of 2180 tandem mass spectra obtained from both triple-quadrupole tandem mass spectrometers (TSQ) and quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometers (LCQ) was created. Comparisons are performed between tandem mass spectra obtained on the same instrument type as well as between different instrument types. Accurate and reliable comparisons are demonstrated in both types of analyses. The scores obtained in the cross-comparison of TSQ and LCQ tandem mass spectra of the same peptide are found to be slightly lower than comparisons performed with spectra obtained on the same instrument type. The method appears insensitive to variations in day-to-day performance of the instrument, minor variations in fragment ion abundance, and instrumental differences inherent in the same instrument model. The use of this method of comparison is demonstrated for library searching and subtractive analysis of tandem mass spectra obtained during LC/MS/MS experiments.},

title = {New and automated MSn approaches for top-down identification of modified proteins},
abstract = {An automated top-down approach including data-dependent MS(3) experiment for protein identification/characterization is described. A mixture of wild-type yeast proteins has been separated on-line using reverse-phase liquid chromatography and introduced into a hybrid linear ion trap (LTQ) Fourier transform ion cylclotron resonance (FTICR) mass spectrometer, where the most abundant molecular ions were automatically isolated and fragmented. The MS(2) spectra were interpreted by an automated algorithm and the resulting fragment mass values were uploaded to the ProSight PTM search engine to identify three yeast proteins, two of which were found to be modified. Subsequent MS(3) analyses pinpointed the location of these modifications. In addition, data-dependent MS(3) experiments were performed on standard proteins and wild-type yeast proteins using the stand alone linear trap mass spectrometer. Initially, the most abundant molecular ions underwent collisionally activated dissociation, followed by data-dependent dissociation of only those MS(2) fragment ions for which a charge state could be automatically determined. The resulting spectra were processed to identify amino acid sequence tags in a robust fashion. New hybrid search modes utilized the MS(3) sequence tag and the absolute mass values of the MS(2) fragment ions to collectively provide unambiguous identification of the standard and wild-type yeast proteins from custom databases harboring a large number of post-translational modifications populated in a combinatorial fashion.},

title = "{De novo peptide sequencing by two-dimensional fragment correlation mass spectrometry}",
abstract = "{A novel concept of two-dimensional fragment correlation mass spectrometry and its application to peptide sequencing is described. The daughter ion (MS2) spectrum of a peptide contains the sequence information of the peptide. However, deciphering the MS2 spectrum, and thus deriving the peptide sequence is complex because of the difficulty in distinguishing the N-terminal fragments (e.g., b series) from the C-terminal fragments (e.g., y series). By taking a granddaughter ion (MS3) spectrum of a particular daughter ion, all fragment ions of the opposite terminus are eliminated in the MS3 spectrum. However, some internal fragments of the peptide will appear in the MS3 spectrum. Because internal fragments are rarely present in the MS2 spectrum, the intersection (a spectrum containing peaks that are present in both spectra) of the MS2 and MS3 spectra should contain only fragments of the same terminal type. A two-dimensional plot of the MS2 spectrum versus the intersection spectra (2-D fragment correlation mass spectrum) often gives enough information to derive the complete sequence of a peptide. This paper describes this novel technique and its application in sequencing cytochrome c and apomyoglobin. For a tryptic digest of cytochrome c, approximately 78% of the protein sequence was determined. For the Glu-C/tryptic digest of apomyoglobin, approximately 66% of the protein sequence was determined.}",

The model includes most fragmentation pathways described in the literature, plus some additional pathways based on the author's observations. The model was trained by optimizing parameters within the model for predictions of CID spectra of known peptides. A best set of parameters was optimized to obtain best match between the simulated spectra and the experimental spectra in a training data set. The performance of the mathematical model and the associated optimized parameter set used in the CID spectra simulation was evaluated by generating predictions for a large number of known peptides, which were not included in the training data set. It was shown that the model is able to predict peptide CID spectra with reasonable accuracy in fragment ion intensities for both singly and doubly charged peptide parent ions up to 2000 u in mass. The optimized parameter set was evaluated to gain insight into the collision-induced peptide fragmentation process.}",

On a lower resolution instrument such as the more widely used quadrupole ion traps, de novo peptide sequencing is not so reliable or requires more MS(3) experiments. However, the peptide CID spectrum has been demonstrated to be quite reproducible on an ion trap instrument and can be predicted with good accuracy. A new de novo peptide sequencing technique, DACSIM, combining a divide-and-conquer algorithm for deriving sequence candidates and spectrum simulation for sequence refinement, is developed for spectra acquired on an ion trap instrument. When DACSIM was used to sequence peptides 500-1900 u in mass generated from proteolytic digests of hemoglobin and myoglobin, the success rate was 70% with a false positive rate of only 6%, when isoleucine and leucine residues were not distinguished.}",

First a list of potential empirical formulae is generated using the accurate mass and isotopic peak intensity ratios from the molecular ion cluster. The formulae are mathematically analyzed to ensure that they correspond to linear peptides composed of 19 common amino acids. Then using the ions below m/z 160 Da, which are characteristic of the amino acid content of the peptide, the formulae are decomposed into possible amino acid compositions. From each composition sequences are generated and their predicted fragment ions are compared to ions present in the mass spectrum. A score based on the intensities and the occurrence of consecutive sequence fragments is calculated. Finally sequences with the ten highest scores are retained. Analyses performed on typical peptides with molecular weights below 1500 Da indicate that identification can generally be achieved using this approach.}",
