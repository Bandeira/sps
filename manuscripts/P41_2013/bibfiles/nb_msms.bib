	phosphorylation analysis could be used to study signaling pathways

	of global phosphorylation analysis is to obtain an in-depth mapping
	of low abundance protein phosphorylation in cells; this necessitates
	the use of suitable separation techniques because of the complexity
	of the phosphoproteome. Here we developed a multidimensional chromatography
	technology, combining IMAC, hydrophilic interaction chromatography,
	and reverse phase LC, for phosphopeptide purification and fractionation.
	Its application to the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae after DNA damage
	led to the identification of 8764 unique phosphopeptides from 2278
	phosphoproteins using tandem MS. Analysis of two low abundance proteins,
	Rad9 and Mrc1, revealed that approximately 50\% of their phosphorylation
	was identified via this global phosphorylation analysis. Thus, this

  pages = {5101-5109},
  abstract = {Almost all protein database search methods use amino acid substitution
	matrices for scoring, optimizing, and assessing the statistical significance
	of sequence alignments. Much care and effort has therefore gone into
	constructing substitution matrices, and the quality of search results
	can depend strongly upon the choice of the proper matrix. A long-standing
	problem has been the comparison of sequences with biased amino acid
	compositions, for which standard substitution matrices are not optimal.
	To address this problem, we have recently developed a general procedure
	for transforming a standard matrix into one appropriate for the comparison
	of two sequences with arbitrary, and possibly differing compositions.
	Such adjusted matrices yield, on average, improved alignments and
	alignment scores when applied to the comparison of proteins with
	markedly biased compositions. Here we review the application of compositionally
	adjusted matrices and consider whether they may also be applied fruitfully
	to general purpose protein sequence database searches, in which related
	sequence pairs do not necessarily have strong compositional biases.
	Although it is not advisable to apply compositional adjustment indiscriminately,
	we describe several simple criteria under which invoking such adjustment
	is on average beneficial. In a typical database search, at least
	one of these criteria is satisfied by over half the related sequence
	pairs. Compositional substitution matrix adjustment is now available

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The key to mass-spectrometry-based proteomics is peptide
	identification, which relies on software analysis of tandem mass
	spectra. Although each search engine has its strength, combining
	the strengths of various search engines is not yet realizable largely
	due to the lack of a unified statistical framework that is applicable
	to any method. RESULTS: We have developed a universal scheme for
	statistical calibration of peptide identifications. The protocol
	can be used for both de novo approaches as well as database search
	methods. We demonstrate the protocol using only the database search
	methods. Among seven methods -SEQUEST (v27 rev12), ProbID (v1.0),
	InsPecT (v20060505), Mascot (v2.1), X!Tandem (v1.0), OMSSA (v2.0)
	and RAId\_DbS - calibrated, except for X!Tandem and RAId\_DbS most
	methods require a rescaling according to the database size searched.
	We demonstrate that our calibration protocol indeed produces unified
	statistics both in terms of average number of false positives and
	in terms of the probability for a peptide hit to be a true positive.
	Although both the protocols for calibration and the statistics thus
	calibrated are universal, the calibration formulas obtained from
	one laboratory with data collected using either centroid or profile
	format may not be directly usable by the other laboratories. Thus
	each laboratory is encouraged to calibrate the search methods it
	intends to use. We also address the importance of using spectrum-specific
	statistics and possible improvement on the current calibration protocol.

  abstract = {Statistically meaningful comparison/combination of peptide identification
	results from various search methods is impeded by the lack of a universal
	statistical standard. Providing an E-value calibration protocol,
	we demonstrated earlier the feasibility of translating either the
	score or heuristic E-value reported by any method into the textbook-defined
	E-value, which may serve as the universal statistical standard. This
	protocol, although robust, may lose spectrum-specific statistics
	and might require a new calibration when changes in experimental
	setup occur. To mitigate these issues, we developed a new MS/MS search
	tool, RAId\_aPS, that is able to provide spectrum-specific-values
	for additive scoring functions. Given a selection of scoring functions
	out of RAId score, K-score, Hyperscore and XCorr, RAId\_aPS generates
	the corresponding score histograms of all possible peptides using
	dynamic programming. Using these score histograms to assign E-values
	enables a calibration-free protocol for accurate significance assignment
	for each scoring function. RAId\_aPS features four different modes:
	(i) compute the total number of possible peptides for a given molecular
	mass range, (ii) generate the score histogram given a MS/MS spectrum
	and a scoring function, (iii) reassign E-values for a list of candidate
	peptides given a MS/MS spectrum and the scoring functions chosen,
	and (iv) perform database searches using selected scoring functions.
	In modes (iii) and (iv), RAId\_aPS is also capable of combining results
	from different scoring functions using spectrum-specific statistics.

  pages = {3726-3732},
  abstract = {MOTIVATION: The key to MS -based proteomics is peptide sequencing.
	The major challenge in peptide sequencing, whether library search
	or de novo, is to better infer statistical significance and better
	attain noise reduction. Since the noise in a spectrum depends on
	experimental conditions, the instrument used and many other factors,
	it cannot be predicted even if the peptide sequence is known. The
	characteristics of the noise can only be uncovered once a spectrum
	is given. We wish to overcome such issues. RESULTS: We designed RAId
	to identify peptides from their associated tandem mass spectrometry
	data. RAId performs a novel de novo sequencing followed by a search
	in a peptide library that we created. Through de novo sequencing,
	we establish the spectrum-specific background score statistics for
	the library search. When the database search fails to return significant
	hits, the top-ranking de novo sequences become potential candidates
	for new peptides that are not yet in the database. The use of spectrum-specific
	background statistics seems to enable RAId to perform well even when
	the spectral quality is marginal. Other important features of RAId
	include its potential in de novo sequencing alone and the ease of
	incorporating post-translational modifications.}

	peptides are becoming increasingly common in the literature. Several
	methods for assessing the reliability of peptide identifications
	both at the individual peptide or data set level have become established.
	However, tools for measuring the confidence of modification site

	estimating phosphorylation site assignment reliabilities have been
	developed, but these are not integral to a search engine, so require
	a particular search engine output for a second step of processing.
	They may also require use of a particular fragmentation method and
	are mostly only applicable for phosphorylation analysis, rather than
	post-translational modifications analysis in general. In this study,
	we present the performance of site assignment scoring that is directly
	integrated into the search engine Protein Prospector, which allows
	site assignment reliability to be automatically reported for all
	modifications present in an identified peptide. It clearly indicates
	when a site assignment is ambiguous (and if so, between which residues),
	and reports an assignment score that can be translated into a reliability
	measure for individual site assignments.},

	activation of the small GTPase RhoA, giving rise to a cleavage furrow.
	Furrow formation relies on positional cues provided by anaphase spindle
	microtubules (MTs), but how such cues are generated remains unclear.
	Using chemical genetics to achieve both temporal and spatial control,
	we show that the self-organized delivery of Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1)
	to the midzone and its local phosphorylation of a MT-bound substrate
	are critical for generating this furrow-inducing signal. When Plk1
	was active but unable to target itself to this equatorial landmark,
	both cortical RhoA recruitment and furrow induction failed to occur,
	thus recapitulating the effects of anaphase-specific Plk1 inhibition.
	Using tandem mass spectrometry and phosphospecific antibodies, we
	found that Plk1 binds and directly phosphorylates the HsCYK-4 subunit
	of centralspindlin (also known as MgcRacGAP) at the midzone. At serine
	157, this modification creates a major docking site for the tandem
	BRCT repeats of the Rho GTP exchange factor Ect2. Cells expressing
	only a nonphosphorylatable form of HsCYK-4 failed to localize Ect2
	at the midzone and were severely impaired in cleavage furrow formation,
	implying that HsCYK-4 is Plk1's rate-limiting target upstream of
	RhoA. Conversely, tethering an inhibitor-resistant allele of Plk1
	to HsCYK-4 allowed furrows to form despite global inhibition of all
	other Plk1 molecules in the cell. Our findings illuminate two key
	mechanisms governing the initiation of cytokinesis in human cells

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Due to the recent advances in technology of mass spectrometry,
	there has been an exponential increase in the amount of data being
	generated in the past few years. Database searches have not been
	able to keep with this data explosion. Thus, speeding up the data
	searches becomes increasingly important in mass-spectrometry-based
	applications. Traditional database search methods use one-against-all
	comparisons of a query spectrum against a very large number of peptides
	generated from in silico digestion of protein sequences in a database,
	to filter potential candidates from this database followed by a detailed
	scoring and ranking of those filtered candidates. RESULTS: In this
	article, we show that we can avoid the one-against-all comparisons.
	The basic idea is to design a set of hash functions to pre-process
	peptides in the database such that for each query spectrum we can
	use the hash functions to find only a small subset of peptide sequences
	that are most likely to match the spectrum. The construction of each
	hash function is based on a random spectrum and the hash value of
	a peptide is the normalized shared peak counts score (cosine) between
	the random spectrum and the hypothetical spectrum of the peptide.
	To implement this idea, we first embed each peptide into a unit vector
	in a high-dimensional metric space. The random spectrum is represented
	by a random vector, and we use random vectors to construct a set
	of hash functions called locality sensitive hashing (LSH) for preprocessing.
	We demonstrate that our mapping is accurate. We show that our method
	can filter out >95.65\% of the spectra without missing any correct
	sequences, or gain 111 times speedup by filtering out 99.64\% of
	spectra while missing at most 0.19\% (2 out of 1014) of the correct
	sequences. In addition, we show that our method can be effectively
	used for other mass spectra mining applications such as finding clusters
	of spectra efficiently and accurately. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

	Traditional search engines, which match peptide sequences with tandem

	the acquisition of tandem mass spectra is not biased toward well-understood
	protein isoforms, this computational strategy is failing to identify
	peptides from alternative splicing and coding SNP protein isoforms
	despite the acquisition of good-quality tandem mass spectra. We propose,
	instead, that expressed sequence tags (ESTs) be searched. Ordinarily,
	such a strategy would be computationally infeasible due to the size
	of EST sequence databases; however, we show that a sophisticated
	sequence database compression strategy, applied to human ESTs, reduces
	the sequence database size approximately 35-fold. Once compressed,
	our EST sequence database is comparable in size to other commonly

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Comparing tandem mass spectra (MSMS) against a known dataset
	of protein sequences is a common method for identifying unknown proteins;
	however, the processing of MSMS by current software often limits
	certain applications, including comprehensive coverage of post-translational
	modifications, non-specific searches and real-time searches to allow
	result-dependent instrument control. This problem deserves attention
	as new mass spectrometers provide the ability for higher throughput
	and as known protein datasets rapidly grow in size. New software
	algorithms need to be devised in order to address the performance
	issues of conventional MSMS protein dataset-based protein identification.
	METHODS: This paper describes a novel algorithm based on converting
	a collection of monoisotopic, centroided spectra to a new data structure,
	named 'peptide finite state machine' (PFSM), which may be used to
	rapidly search a known dataset of protein sequences, regardless of
	the number of spectra searched or the number of potential modifications
	examined. The algorithm is verified using a set of commercially available
	tryptic digest protein standards analyzed using an ABI 4700 MALDI
	TOFTOF mass spectrometer, and a free, open source PFSM implementation.
	It is illustrated that a PFSM can accurately search large collections
	of spectra against large datasets of protein sequences (e.g. NCBI
	nr) using a regular desktop PC; however, this paper only details
	the method for identifying peptide and subsequently protein candidates
	from a dataset of known protein sequences. The concept of using a
	PFSM as a peptide pre-screening technique for MSMS-based search engines
	is validated by using PFSM with Mascot and XTandem. AVAILABILITY:
	Complete source code, documentation and examples for the reference
	PFSM implementation are freely available at the Proteome Commons,

	a comprehensive understanding of the chemical structure of a protein.
	The basic strategy for obtaining this information involves the identification
	of disulfide-linked peptides in digests of proteins and the characterization
	of their half-cystinyl peptide constituents. Tools for disulfide
	bond analysis have improved dramatically in the past two decades,
	especially in terms of speed and sensitivity. This improvement is
	largely due to the development of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization
	(MALDI) and electrospray ionization (ESI), and complementary analyzers
	with high resolution and accuracy. The process of pairing half-cystinyl
	peptides is now generally achieved by comparing masses of non-reduced
	and reduced aliquots of a digest of a protein that was proteolyzed
	with intact disulfide bonds. Pepsin has favorable properties for
	generating disulfide-linked peptides, including its acidic pH optimum,
	at which disulfide bond rearrangement is precluded and protein conformations
	are likely to be unfolded and accessible to cleavage, and broad substrate
	specificity. These properties potentiate cleavage between all half-cystine
	residues of the substrate protein. However, pepsin produces complex
	digests that contain overlapping peptides due to ragged cleavage.
	This complexity can produce very complex spectra and/or hamper the
	ionization of some constituent peptides. It may also be more difficult
	to compute which half-cystinyl sequences of the protein of interest
	are disulfide-linked in non-reduced peptic digests. This ambiguity
	is offset to some extent by sequence tags that may arise from ragged
	cleavages and aid sequence assignments. Problems associated with
	pepsin cleavage can be minimized by digestion in solvents that contain
	50\% H(2) (18)O. Resultant disulfide-linked peptides have distinct

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the last decade, techniques were established for the
	large scale genome-wide analysis of proteins, RNA, and metabolites,
	and database solutions have been developed to manage the generated
	data sets. The Golm Metabolome Database for metabolite data (GMD)
	represents one such effort to make these data broadly available and
	to interconnect the different molecular levels of a biological system
	1. As data interpretation in the light of already existing data becomes
	increasingly important, these initiatives are an essential part of
	current and future systems biology. RESULTS: A mass spectral library
	consisting of experimentally derived tryptic peptide product ion
	spectra was generated based on liquid chromatography coupled to ion
	trap mass spectrometry (LC-IT-MS). Protein samples derived from Arabidopsis
	thaliana, Chlamydomonas reinhardii, Medicago truncatula, and Sinorhizobium
	meliloti were analysed. With currently 4,557 manually validated spectra
	associated with 4,226 unique peptides from 1,367 proteins, the database
	serves as a continuously growing reference data set and can be used
	for protein identification and quantification in uncharacterized
	biological samples. For peptide identification, several algorithms
	were implemented based on a recently published study for peptide
	mass fingerprinting 2 and tested for false positive and negative
	rates. An algorithm which considers intensity distribution for match
	correlation scores was found to yield best results. For proof of
	concept, an LC-IT-MS analysis of a tryptic leaf protein digest was
	converted to mzData format and searched against the mass spectral
	library. The utility of the mass spectral library was also tested
	for the identification of phosphorylated tryptic peptides. We included
	in vivo phosphorylation sites of Arabidopsis thaliana proteins and
	the identification performance was found to be improved compared
	to genome-based search algorithms. Protein identification by ProMEX
	is linked to other levels of biological organization such as metabolite,
	pathway, and transcript data. The database is further connected to
	annotation and classification services via BioMoby. CONCLUSION: The
	ProMEX protein/peptide database represents a mass spectral reference
	library with the capability of matching unknown samples for protein
	identification. The database allows text searches based on metadata
	such as experimental information of the samples, mass spectrometric
	instrument parameters or unique protein identifier like AGI codes.
	ProMEX integrates proteomics data with other levels of molecular
	organization including metabolite, pathway, and transcript information
	and may thus become a useful resource for plant systems biology studies.
	The ProMEX mass spectral library is available at http://promex.mpimp-golm.mpg.de/.},

	a more recent type of fragmentation termed HCD (higher energy collisional

	ions at high resolution in the orbitrap mass analyzer. Here we compared
	HCD to traditional CID for large-scale phosphorylation analyses of

	included a same-precursor analysis where CID and HCD scans were performed
	back-to-back, separate analyses of a phosphotyrosine peptide immunoprecipitation

	a full phosphoproteome study of mouse brain, the greater acquisition

	possible when sensitive peptide mass mapping techniques were developed,
	thereby allowing for the possibility of identifying and cataloging
	most 2D gel electrophoresis spots. Shortly thereafter a few groups
	pioneered the idea of identifying proteins by using peptide tandem
	mass spectra to search protein sequence databases. Hence, it became
	possible to identify proteins from very complex mixtures. One drawback
	to these latter techniques is that it is not entirely straightforward
	to make matches using tandem mass spectra of peptides that are modified
	or have sequences that differ slightly from what is present in the
	sequence database that is being searched. This has been part of the
	motivation behind automated de novo sequencing programs that attempt
	to derive a peptide sequence regardless of its presence in a sequence
	database. The sequence candidates thus generated are then subjected
	to homology-based database search programs (e.g., BLAST or FASTA).
	These homology search programs, however, were not developed with
	mass spectrometry in mind, and it became necessary to make minor
	modifications such that mass spectrometric ambiguities can be taken
	into account when comparing query and database sequences. Finally,
	this review will discuss the important issue of validating protein

	for identification of proteins from complex mixtures. Proteins are
	digested to peptides that are then identified by their fragmentation
	patterns in the mass spectrometer. Thus, at its core, MS/MS protein
	identification relies on the relative predictability of peptide fragmentation.
	Unfortunately, peptide fragmentation is complex and not fully understood,
	and what is understood is not always exploited by peptide identification
	algorithms. RESULTS: We use a hybrid dynamic Bayesian network (DBN)/support
	vector machine (SVM) approach to address these two problems. We train
	a set of DBNs on high-confidence peptide-spectrum matches. These
	DBNs, known collectively as Riptide, comprise a probabilistic model
	of peptide fragmentation chemistry. Examination of the distributions
	learned by Riptide allows identification of new trends, such as prevalent
	a-ion fragmentation at peptide cleavage sites C-term to hydrophobic
	residues. In addition, Riptide can be used to produce likelihood
	scores that indicate whether a given peptide-spectrum match is correct.
	A vector of such scores is evaluated by an SVM, which produces a
	final score to be used in peptide identification. Using Riptide in
	this way yields improved discrimination when compared to other state-of-the-art
	MS/MS identification algorithms, increasing the number of positive
	identifications by as much as 12\% at a 1\% false discovery rate.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND:Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) has become the primary
	way for protein identification in proteomics. A good score function
	for measuring the match quality between a peptide and an MS/MS spectrum
	is instrumental for the protein identification. Traditionally the
	to-be-measured peptides are fragmented with the collision induced
	dissociation (CID) method. More recently, the electron transfer dissociation
	(ETD) method was introduced and has proven to produce better fragment
	ion ladders for larger and more basic peptides. However, the existing
	software programs that analyze ETD MS/MS data are not as advanced
	as they are for CID.RESULTS:To take full advantage of ETD data, in
	this paper we develop a new score function to evaluate the match
	between a peptide and an ETD MS/MS spectrum. Experiments on real
	data demonstrated that this newly developed score function significantly
	improved the de novo sequencing accuracy of the PEAKS software on
	ETD data.CONCLUSION:A new and better score function for ETD MS/MS
	peptide identification was developed. The method used to develop
	our ETD score function can be easily reused to train new score functions
	for other types of MS/MS data.}

  abstract = {{Motivation: Tandem mass spectrometry combined with sequence database
	searching is one of the most powerful tools for protein identification.
	As thousands of spectra are generated by a mass spectrometer in one
	hour, the speed of database searching is critical, especially when
	searching against a large sequence database, or when the peptide
	is generated by some unknown or non-specific enzyme, even or when
	the target peptides have post-translational modifications (PTM).
	In practice, about 70-90\% of the spectra have no match in the database.
	Many believe that a significant portion of them are due to peptides
	of non-specific digestions by unknown enzymes or amino acid modifications.
	In another case, scientists may choose to use some non-specific enzymes
	such as pepsin or thermolysin for proteolysis in proteomic study,
	in that not all proteins are amenable to be digested by some site-specific
	enzymes, and furthermore many digested peptides may not fall within
	the rang of molecular weight suitable for mass spectrometry analysis.
	Interpretating mass spectra of these kinds will cost a lot of computational
	time of database search engines. Overview: The present study was
	designed to speed up the database searching process for both cases.
	More specifically speaking, we employed an approach combining suffix
	tree data structure and spectrum graph. The suffix tree is used to
	preprocess the protein sequence database, while the spectrum graph
	is used to preprocess the tandem mass spectrum. We then search the
	suffix tree against the spectrum graph for candidate peptides. We
	design an efficient algorithm to compute a matching threshold with
	some statistical significance level, e.g. p = 0.01, for each spectrum,
	and use it to select candidate peptides. Then we rank these peptides
	using a SEQUEST-like scoring function. The algorithms were implemented
	and tested on experimental data. For post-translational modifications,
	we allow arbitrary number of any modification to a protein. Availability:

	mixtures. Here we describe a method, termed SILAC, for stable isotope
	labeling by amino acids in cell culture, for the in vivo incorporation
	of specific amino acids into all mammalian proteins. Mammalian cell
	lines are grown in media lacking a standard essential amino acid
	but supplemented with a non-radioactive, isotopically labeled form
	of that amino acid, in this case deuterated leucine (Leu-d3). We
	find that growth of cells maintained in these media is no different
	from growth in normal media as evidenced by cell morphology, doubling
	time, and ability to differentiate. Complete incorporation of Leu-d3
	occurred after five doublings in the cell lines and proteins studied.
	Protein populations from experimental and control samples are mixed
	directly after harvesting, and mass spectrometric identification
	is straightforward as every leucine-containing peptide incorporates
	either all normal leucine or all Leu-d3. We have applied this technique
	to the relative quantitation of changes in protein expression during
	the process of muscle cell differentiation. Proteins that were found
	to be up-regulated during this process include glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
	dehydrogenase, fibronectin, and pyruvate kinase M2. SILAC is a simple,
	inexpensive, and accurate procedure that can be used as a quantitative

abstract = {Protein post-translational modifications (PTMs) at the lysine residue, such as lysine methylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination, are diverse, abundant, and dynamic. They play a key role in the regulation of diverse cellular physiology. Here we report discovery of a new type of lysine PTM, lysine malonylation (Kmal). Kmal was initially detected by mass spectrometry and protein sequence-database searching. The modification was comprehensively validated by Western blot, tandem MS, and high-performance liquid chromatography of synthetic peptides, isotopic labeling, and identification of multiple Kmal substrate proteins. Kmal is a dynamic and evolutionarily conserved PTM observed in mammalian cells and bacterial cells. In addition, we demonstrate that Sirt5, a member of the class III lysine deacetylases, can catalyze lysine demalonylation and lysine desuccinylation reactions both in vitro and in vivo. This result suggests the possibility of nondeacetylation activity of other class III lysine deacetylases, especially those without obvious acetylation protein substrates. Our results therefore reveal a new type of PTM pathway and identify the first enzyme that can regulate lysine malonylation and lysine succinylation status.},

	O-glycosylation are O-fucosylation, O-mannosylation, and O-glucosylation,
	but they are functionally of high relevance for early stages of development
	and for vital physiological functions of proteins. Glycosaminoglycans
	are a-linked to proteoglycans via a xylose-containing tetrasaccharide,
	represented by linear chains of repetitive disaccharides modified
	by carboxylates and O- or/and N-linked sulfates. Analysis of O-glycosylation

	diversity of glycan and protein factors. The parameters in structural
	analysis of O-glycans include determination of (i) O-glycosylation

	protocol, is beneficial for determination of O-acetylation and oversulfation
	(Bindila et al., 2004a; Zamfir et al., 2004a). O-glycomics by robotized
	chip-electrospray/ionization (ESI)-MS and MS/MS on the quadrupole

	resonance ejection MS/MS product ion scans. Dissociation of the [M

	of the [M + 20H](20+) charge state resulted in a single dominant
	y(96) product ion formed by fragmentation between adjacent Ile/Gly
	residues, with only limited sequence coverage. Further extensive
	sequence information was readily obtained however, by MS(3) dissociation
	of this initial product. From the combined MS/MS and MS(3) spectra
	an overall sequence coverage of 66.9\%, with fragmentation of 85

	by characterization of product ions resulting from fragmentation

	MS/MS and MS(3) of the K107A mutant led to significantly different
	product ion spectra dominated by cleavages occurring N-terminal to
	proline, which restricted the ability to localize the modification
	site to within only an 8 amino acid region of the sequence. This

	We demonstrate the application of a new analysis technique based
	on mathematical correlation that is computationally efficient and
	robust against different instruments, noise levels, and experimental
	conditions. We have previously shown that this technique is able
	to extract pertinent mass shift signals from MS data, corresponding
	to the neutral loss of a modification from a peptide, e.g., a loss
	of 79.97 Th from phosphorylated tyrosine. Here we show that an extension
	of this method is applicable to MS and MS/MS data in general, allowing
	visualization of ions that produce a particular mass shift signal,
	be it from differential stable isotope labeling, overlap of fragment
	ions in a series, or ions that produce a neutral loss. The application

	(EDX). Histology verified the extended lens bow for albino and pigmented
	rats and showed that in the intermittent period of normal diet the
	fibre nuclei are broken down as in controls. It was further shown
	that gamma-crystallins are co-localized with DNA in the nuclear domain.
	TEM revealed that during final differentiation nuclear chromatin
	becomes highly compacted in a chromosome-like manner and than rapidly
	evanesces in control rats. This compacted stage persists indefinitely
	in the tryptophan deficient rats. Electron tomography showed that
	during differentiation chromatin is first uncoiled to 30 nm solenoids,
	subsequently to highly compacted 10 nm beads-on-a-string fibrils
	and than is segregated from the nuclear proteins. EDX revealed that
	the late stage persisting nuclei consist of domains rich in DNA associated
	with histones and in domains with mainly proteins. This study corroborates
	previous findings on the final breakdown of nuclei of lens fibres.
	It further shows that the chromatin is ultimately uncoiled to beads-on-a-string
	fibrils and that as the last step chromatin is broken down at this
	unmasked stage. Except for this last step nuclear breakdown is identical
	in control and tryptophan deficient rats suggesting that it is not
	the availability of tryptophan for protein synthesis in general which
	causes the arrest. Two alternatives for this final arrest are discussed.
	A low tryptophan content, most pronounced in deeper cortical layers,
	may inhibit the late synthesis of the DNases and proteases necessary
	for chromatin breakdown. The radical scavenging by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase,
	which cleaves the pyrrole ring of tryptophan to form formylkynurenine
	using free oxygen radicals, is impaired by low levels of tryptophan.
	This decreased scavenging of oxygen radicals will expose the catalytic
	enzymes for chromatin breakdown, residing in the nucleus in an inactive
	form for quite a long period, to high levels of oxygen radicals and
	may affect the activity of these enzymes and therefore the execution
	of the chromatin breakdown.}

	for many applications. RESULTS: The pairwise peak-list comparison
	is a multistage process composed of matching of peaks embedded in
	two peak-lists, normalisation, scaling of peak intensities and dissimilarity
	measures. In our analysis, we focused on binary and intensity based
	measures. We have modified the measures in order to comprise the
	mass spectrometry specific properties of mass measurement accuracy
	and non-matching peaks. We compared the labelling of peak-list pairs,
	obtained using different factors of the pairwise peak-list comparison,
	as being the same or different to those determined by sequence database
	searches. In order to elucidate how these factors influence the peak-list
	comparison we adopted an analysis of variance type method with the
	partial area under the ROC curve as a dependent variable. CONCLUSION:
	The analysis of variance provides insight into the relevance of various
	factors influencing the outcome of the pairwise peak-list comparison.
	For large MS/MS and PMF data sets the outcome of ANOVA analysis was
	consistent, providing a strong indication that the results presented
	here might be valid for many various types of peptide mass measurements.}

	library search is a new and promising computational approach to mass

	in identification of unanticipated post-translational modifications
	has rarely been explored. The existing spectral library search tools
	are designed to match the query spectrum to the reference library
	spectra with the same peptide mass. Thus, spectra of peptides with
	unanticipated modifications cannot be identified. RESULTS: In this
	article, we present an open spectral library search tool, named pMatch.
	It extends the existing library search algorithms in at least three
	aspects to support the identification of unanticipated modifications.
	First, the spectra in library are optimized with the full peptide
	sequence information to better tolerate the peptide fragmentation
	pattern variations caused by some modification(s). Second, a new
	scoring system is devised, which uses charge-dependent mass shifts
	for peak matching and combines a probability-based model with the
	general spectral dot-product for scoring. Third, a target-decoy strategy
	is used for false discovery rate control. To demonstrate the effectiveness
	of pMatch, a library search experiment was conducted on a public
	dataset with over 40,000 spectra in comparison with SpectraST, the
	most popular library search engine. Additional validations were done
	on four published datasets including over 150,000 spectra. The results

	energies (3-13 eV) induces secondary fragmentation in radical z.
	fragments; this hot ECD (HECD) allows one to distinguish between
	the isomeric leucine and isoleucine residues. If a hot electron is
	not captured, then the induced electronic excitation converts internally
	into vibrational energy, resulting in fragmentation of the C(O)bond;N
	backbone bond (so-called EIEIO process). Above 9-10 eV, further ionization
	of n-charged cations occurs. If the formed (n + 1)+. cations capture
	electrons, then the C(alpha)bond;C backbone bond is usually broken.
	For anions that collide with approximately 20 eV electrons, the ejection
	of an electron leads to the creation of a radical positive charge
	(hole) that recombines internally with a negative charge. Such recombination
	leads to various backbone bond cleavages. This electron-detachment
	dissociation (EDD) is analogous to ECD for negative ions.}

  abstract = {New ion fragmentation technologies--electron capture dissociation
	(ECD) and electron-transfer dissociation (ETD)--are based on interaction
	of multiply charged polypeptides with either free electrons (ECD)
	or anionic species (ETD). After initial difficulties, these ECD/ETD
	(ExD) technologies are now being increasingly implemented in high-throughput
	proteomics work. This critical analysis presents arguments for the
	combined use of ExD with the conventional low-energy collisional
	excitation CID/CAD (CxD). It is argued that the database search,
	a key technology in MS/MS-based proteomics, is vulnerable with respect
	to the incomplete sequence information obtainable with either of
	the techniques, peptide MS/MS homology being a major complicating
	factor. De novo sequencing is viewed as the only adequate answer
	to this challenge and it can be achieved only with combined use of
	ExD and CxD. The payoff in the form of additional sequence information
	is projected to exceed the costs of such implementation. The greatest
	impact of combining ExD and CxD is expected in high-resolution instruments.}
