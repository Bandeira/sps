abstract = "{We present here a draft genome sequence of the red jungle fowl, Gallus gallus. Because the chicken is a modern descendant of the dinosaurs and the first non-mammalian amniote to have its genome sequenced, the draft sequence of its genome--composed of approximately one billion base pairs of sequence and an estimated 20,000-23,000 genes--provides a new perspective on vertebrate genome evolution, while also improving the annotation of mammalian genomes. For example, the evolutionary distance between chicken and human provides high specificity in detecting functional elements, both non-coding and coding. Notably, many conserved non-coding sequences are far from genes and cannot be assigned to defined functional classes. In coding regions the evolutionary dynamics of protein domains and orthologous groups illustrate processes that distinguish the lineages leading to birds and mammals. The distinctive properties of avian microchromosomes, together with the inferred patterns of conserved synteny, provide additional insights into vertebrate chromosome architecture.}",

title = {Whole-genome shotgun assembly and comparison of human genome assemblies},
abstract = {We report a whole-genome shotgun assembly (called WGSA) of the human genome generated at Celera in 2001. The Celera-generated shotgun data set consisted of 27 million sequencing reads organized in pairs by virtue of end-sequencing 2-kbp, 10-kbp, and 50-kbp inserts from shotgun clone libraries. The quality-trimmed reads covered the genome 5.3 times, and the inserts from which pairs of reads were obtained covered the genome 39 times. With the nearly complete human DNA sequence [National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Build 34] now available, it is possible to directly assess the quality, accuracy, and completeness of WGSA and of the first reconstructions of the human genome reported in two landmark papers in February 2001 [Venter, J. C., Adams, M. D., Myers, E. W., Li, P. W., Mural, R. J., Sutton, G. G., Smith, H. O., Yandell, M., Evans, C. A., Holt, R. A., et al. (2001) Science 291, 1304-1351; International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium (2001) Nature 409, 860-921]. The analysis of WGSA shows 97% order and orientation agreement with NCBI Build 34, where most of the 3% of sequence out of order is due to scaffold placement problems as opposed to assembly errors within the scaffolds themselves. In addition, WGSA fills some of the remaining gaps in NCBI Build 34. The early genome sequences all covered about the same amount of the genome, but they did so in different ways. The Celera results provide more order and orientation, and the consortium sequence provides better coverage of exact and nearly exact repeats.},

abstract = {One of the most complex and computationally intensive tasks of genome sequence analysis is genome assembly. Even today, few centres have the resources, in both software and hardware, to assemble a genome from the thousands or millions of individual sequences generated in a whole-genome shotgun sequencing project. With the rapid growth in the number of sequenced genomes has come an increase in the number of organisms for which two or more closely related species have been sequenced. This has created the possibility of building a comparative genome assembly algorithm, which can assemble a newly sequenced genome by mapping it onto a reference genome. We describe here a novel algorithm for comparative genome assembly that can accurately assemble a typical bacterial genome in less than four minutes on a standard desktop computer. The software is available as part of the open-source AMOS project.},

title = "{The sequence of the human genome}",
abstract = "{A 2.91-billion base pair (bp) consensus sequence of the euchromatic portion of the human genome was generated by the whole-genome shotgun sequencing method. The 14.8-billion bp DNA sequence was generated over 9 months from 27,271,853 high-quality sequence reads (5.11-fold coverage of the genome) from both ends of plasmid clones made from the DNA of five individuals. Two assembly strategies-a whole-genome assembly and a regional chromosome assembly-were used, each combining sequence data from Celera and the publicly funded genome effort. The public data were shredded into 550-bp segments to create a 2.9-fold coverage of those genome regions that had been sequenced, without including biases inherent in the cloning and assembly procedure used by the publicly funded group. This brought the effective coverage in the assemblies to eightfold, reducing the number and size of gaps in the final assembly over what would be obtained with 5.11-fold coverage. The two assembly strategies yielded very similar results that largely agree with independent mapping data. The assemblies effectively cover the euchromatic regions of the human chromosomes. More than 90% of the genome is in scaffold assemblies of 100,000 bp or more, and 25% of the genome is in scaffolds of 10 million bp or larger. Analysis of the genome sequence revealed 26,588 protein-encoding transcripts for which there was strong corroborating evidence and an additional approximately 12,000 computationally derived genes with mouse matches or other weak supporting evidence. Although gene-dense clusters are obvious, almost half the genes are dispersed in low G+C sequence separated by large tracts of apparently noncoding sequence. Only 1.1% of the genome is spanned by exons, whereas 24% is in introns, with 75% of the genome being intergenic DNA. Duplications of segmental blocks, ranging in size up to chromosomal lengths, are abundant throughout the genome and reveal a complex evolutionary history. Comparative genomic analysis indicates vertebrate expansions of genes associated with neuronal function, with tissue-specific developmental regulation, and with the hemostasis and immune systems. DNA sequence comparisons between the consensus sequence and publicly funded genome data provided locations of 2.1 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). A random pair of human haploid genomes differed at a rate of 1 bp per 1250 on average, but there was marked heterogeneity in the level of polymorphism across the genome. Less than 1% of all SNPs resulted in variation in proteins, but the task of determining which SNPs have functional consequences remains an open challenge.}",

title = {Assembly of polymorphic genomes: algorithms and application to Ciona savignyi},
abstract = {Whole-genome assembly is now used routinely to obtain high-quality draft sequence for the genomes of species with low levels of polymorphism. However, genome assembly remains extremely challenging for highly polymorphic species. The difficulty arises because two divergent haplotypes are sequenced together, making it difficult to distinguish alleles at the same locus from paralogs at different loci. We present here a method for assembling highly polymorphic diploid genomes that involves assembling the two haplotypes separately and then merging them to obtain a reference sequence. Our method was developed to assemble the genome of the sea squirt Ciona savignyi, which was sequenced to a depth of 12.7 x from a single wild individual. By comparing finished clones of the two haplotypes we determined that the sequenced individual had an extremely high heterozygosity rate, averaging 4.6% with significant regional variation and rearrangements at all physical scales. Applied to these data, our method produced a reference assembly covering 157 Mb, with N50 contig and scaffold sizes of 47 kb and 989 kb, respectively. Alignment of ESTs indicates that 88% of loci are present at least once and 81% exactly once in the reference assembly. Our method represented loci in a single copy more reliably and achieved greater contiguity than a conventional whole-genome assembly method.},
