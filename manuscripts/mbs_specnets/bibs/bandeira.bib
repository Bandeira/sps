abstract = "{The analysis of mass spectrometry data is still largely
based on identification of \emph{single} MS/MS spectra and does
not attempt to make use of the extra information available in
\emph{multiple} MS/MS spectra from partially or completely
overlapping peptides. Analysis of MS/MS spectra from multiple
overlapping peptides opens up the possibility of assembling MS/MS
spectra into entire proteins, similarly to the assembly of
overlapping DNA reads into entire genomes. In this paper we
present for the first time a way to detect, score and interpret
overlaps between uninterpreted MS/MS spectra in an attempt to
sequence entire proteins rather than individual peptides. We show
that this approach not only extends the length of reconstructed
amino acid sequences but also dramatically improves the quality of
\emph{de-novo} peptide sequencing, even for low mass accuracy
MS/MS data.}",

title = {Spectral networks: a new approach to de novo discovery of protein sequences and posttranslational modifications},
abstract = {Significant technological advances have accelerated high-throughput proteomics to the automated generation of millions of tandem mass spectra on a daily basis. In such a setup, the desire for greater sequence coverage combines with standard experimental procedures to commonly yield multiple tandem mass spectra from overlapping peptides-typical observations include peptides differing by one or two terminal amino acids and spectra from modified and unmodified variants of the same peptides. In a departure from the traditional spectrum identification algorithms that analyze each tandem mass spectrum in isolation, spectral networks define a new computational approach that instead finds and simultaneously interprets sets of spectra from overlapping peptides. In shotgun protein sequencing, spectral networks capitalize on the redundant sequence information in the aligned spectra to deliver the longest and most accurate de novo sequences ever reported for ion trap data. Also, by combining spectra from multiple modified and unmodified variants of the same peptides, spectral networks are able to bypass the dominant guess/confirm approach to the identification of posttranslational modifications and alternatively discover modifications and highly modified peptides directly from experimental data. Open-source implementations of these algorithms may be downloaded from peptide.ucsd.edu.},

title = {Clustering millions of tandem mass spectra},
abstract = {Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) experiments often generate redundant data sets containing multiple spectra of the same peptides. Clustering of MS/MS spectra takes advantage of this redundancy by identifying multiple spectra of the same peptide and replacing them with a single representative spectrum. Analyzing only representative spectra results in significant speed-up of MS/MS database searches. We present an efficient clustering approach for analyzing large MS/MS data sets (over 10 million spectra) with a capability to reduce the number of spectra submitted to further analysis by an order of magnitude. The MS/MS database search of clustered spectra results in fewer spurious hits to the database and increases number of peptide identifications as compared to regular nonclustered searches. Our open source software MS-Clustering is available for download at http://peptide.ucsd.edu or can be run online at http://proteomics.bioprojects.org/MassSpec.},

We study an alternative approach when all plausible de novo interpretations of a spectrum (spectral dictionary) are generated and then quickly matched against the database. We present a new MS-Dictionary algorithm for efficiently generating spectral dictionaries and demonstrate that MS-Dictionary can identify spectra that are missed in the database search. We argue that MS-Dictionary enables proteogenomics searches in six-frame translation of genomic sequences that may be prohibitively time-consuming for existing database search approaches. We show that such searches allow one to correct sequencing errors and find programmed frameshifts.},

abstract = {Despite many efforts in the last decade, the progress in de novo peptide sequencing has been slow with only 30-45% of all peptides being correctly reconstructed. We argue that accurate full-length peptide sequencing may be an unattainable goal for some spectra and demonstrate how to accurately sequence gapped peptides instead. We further argue that gapped peptides are nearly as useful as full-length peptides for error-tolerant database searches. Gapped peptides occupy a niche between long but inaccurate full-length reconstructions and short but accurate peptide sequence tags. Our MS-Profile tool uses spectral profiles, a new representation of tandem mass spectra, to generate gapped peptides that are longer and more accurate than peptide sequence tags of length 3 traditionally used to speed-up database searches in proteomics. In addition, spectral profiles enable intuitive visualization of all high scoring de novo reconstructions of tandem mass spectra.},

title = {The generating function of CID, ETD, and CID/ETD pairs of tandem mass spectra: applications to database search},
abstract = {Recent emergence of new mass spectrometry techniques (e.g. electron transfer dissociation, ETD) and improved availability of additional proteases (e.g. Lys-N) for protein digestion in high-throughput experiments raised the challenge of designing new algorithms for interpreting the resulting new types of tandem mass (MS/MS) spectra. Traditional MS/MS database search algorithms such as SEQUEST and Mascot were originally designed for collision induced dissociation (CID) of tryptic peptides and are largely based on expert knowledge about fragmentation of tryptic peptides (rather than machine learning techniques) to design CID-specific scoring functions. As a result, the performance of these algorithms is suboptimal for new mass spectrometry technologies or nontryptic peptides. We recently proposed the generating function approach (MS-GF) for CID spectra of tryptic peptides. In this study, we extend MS-GF to automatically derive scoring parameters from a set of annotated MS/MS spectra of any type (e.g. CID, ETD, etc.), and present a new database search tool MS-GFDB based on MS-GF. We show that MS-GFDB outperforms Mascot for ETD spectra or peptides digested with Lys-N. For example, in the case of ETD spectra, the number of tryptic and Lys-N peptides identified by MS-GFDB increased by a factor of 2.7 and 2.6 as compared with Mascot. Moreover, even following a decade of Mascot developments for analyzing CID spectra of tryptic peptides, MS-GFDB (that is not particularly tailored for CID spectra or tryptic peptides) resulted in 28% increase over Mascot in the number of peptide identifications. Finally, we propose a statistical framework for analyzing multiple spectra from the same precursor (e.g. CID/ETD spectral pairs) and assigning p values to peptide-spectrum-spectrum matches.},

abstract = {The success of high-throughput proteomics hinges on the ability of computational methods to identify peptides from tandem mass spectra (MS/MS). However, a common limitation of most peptide identification approaches is the nearly ubiquitous assumption that each MS/MS spectrum is generated from a single peptide. We propose a new computational approach for the identification of mixture spectra generated from more than one peptide. Capitalizing on the growing availability of large libraries of single-peptide spectra (spectral libraries), our quantitative approach is able to identify up to 98% of all mixture spectra from equally abundant peptides and automatically adjust to varying abundance ratios of up to 10:1. Furthermore, we show how theoretical bounds on spectral similarity avoid the need to compare each experimental spectrum against all possible combinations of candidate peptides (achieving speedups of over five orders of magnitude) and demonstrate that mixture-spectra can be identified in a matter of seconds against proteome-scale spectral libraries. Although our approach was developed for and is demonstrated on peptide spectra, we argue that the generality of the methods allows for their direct application to other types of spectral libraries and mixture spectra.},
