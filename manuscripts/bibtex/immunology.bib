title = {Stability of protein production from recombinant mammalian cells},
abstract = {One of the most important criteria for successful generation of a therapeutic protein from a recombinant cell is to obtain a cell line that maintains stability of production. If this is not achieved it can generate problems for process yields, effective use of time and money, and for regulatory approval of products. However, selection of a cell line that sustains stability of production over the required time period may be difficult to achieve during development of a therapeutic protein. There are several studies in the literature that have reported on the instability of protein production from recombinant cell lines. The causes of instability of production are varied and, in many cases, the exact molecular mechanisms are unknown. The production of proteins by cells is modulated by molecular events at levels ranging from transcription, posttranscriptional processing, translation, posttranslational processing, to secretion. There is potential for regulation of stability of protein production at many or all of these stages. In this study we review published information on stability of protein production for three industrially important cell lines: hybridoma, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO), and nonsecreting (NS0) myeloma cell lines. We highlight the most likely molecular loci at which instability may be engendered and indicate other areas of protein production that may affect stability from mammalian cells. We also outline approaches that could help to overcome the problems associated with unpredictable expression levels and maximized production, and indicate the consequences these might have for stability of production.},

title = {Molecular mechanisms of antibody somatic hypermutation},
abstract = {Functional antibody genes are assembled by V-D-J joining and then diversified by somatic hypermutation. This hypermutation results from stepwise incorporation of single nucleotide substitutions into the V gene, underpinning much of antibody diversity and affinity maturation. Hypermutation is triggered by activation-induced deaminase (AID), an enzyme which catalyzes targeted deamination of deoxycytidine residues in DNA. The pathways used for processing the AID-generated U:G lesions determine the variety of base substitutions observed during somatic hypermutation. Thus, DNA replication across the uracil yields transition mutations at C:G pairs, whereas uracil excision by UNG uracil-DNA glycosylase creates abasic sites that can also yield transversions. Recognition of the U:G mismatch by MSH2/MSH6 triggers a mutagenic patch repair in which polymerase eta plays a major role and leads to mutations at A:T pairs. AID-triggered DNA deamination also underpins immunoglobulin variable (IgV) gene conversion, isotype class switching, and some oncogenic translocations in B cell tumors.},

abstract = {Antibodies have been used as therapeutics in various forms for over a century. Traditional immunoglobulin therapy has the advantage of reflecting the diversity of the natural immune response but has very limited clinical applications. However, over the past ten years more than 30 monoclonal antibodies have been successfully introduced on to the drug market. The monoclonal approach provides the advantage of specificity, but lacks efficacy in the treatment of diseases caused by complex antigens. Recombinant polyclonal antibodies, the third generation of antibody therapeutics, have the ability to tackle complex and highly mutagenic targets, and will undoubtedly offer a promising commercial future.},

title = {Immunoglobulin gene diversification},
abstract = {Three processes alter genomic sequence and structure at the immunoglobulin genes of B lymphocytes: gene conversion, somatic hypermutation, and class switch recombination. Though the molecular signatures of these processes differ, they occur by a shared pathway which is induced by targeted DNA deamination by a B cell-specific factor, activation induced cytidine deaminase (AID). Ubiquitous factors critical for DNA repair carry out all downstream steps, creating mutations and deletions in genomic DNA. This review focuses on the genetic and biochemical mechanisms of diversification of immunoglobulin genes.},

title = {Combinatorial events in generation of antibody diversity},
abstract = {Combinatorial association of immunoglobulin gene elements is the most important process in the creation of extreme diversity of antibody molecules. The recombination of germ-line variable gene elements V, D, and J can potentially generate approximately 6000 variable genes of human heavy chains. As joining of these elements is imprecise and is occurring with nucleotide additions or deletions, the created diversity is in fact much higher. The assembled variable genes can be revised and edited resulting in a change of their affinity and even specificity. Due to somatic hypermutation, the affinity of synthesized antibody increases even more. Another variant of combinatorial recombination is joining of complete variable genes with one of the several constant genes and the formation of various immunoglobulin isotypes with different effector functions but with the same antibody specificity. Consequently, these processes not only develop the antibody repertoire but also solve some other problems of the adaptive immune response.},
