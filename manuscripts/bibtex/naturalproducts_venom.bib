title = {IKK-beta links inflammation to obesity-induced insulin resistance},
abstract = {Inflammation may underlie the metabolic disorders of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. IkappaB kinase beta (IKK-beta, encoded by Ikbkb) is a central coordinator of inflammatory responses through activation of NF-kappaB. To understand the role of IKK-beta in insulin resistance, we used mice lacking this enzyme in hepatocytes (Ikbkb(Deltahep)) or myeloid cells (Ikbkb(Deltamye)). Ikbkb(Deltahep) mice retain liver insulin responsiveness, but develop insulin resistance in muscle and fat in response to high fat diet, obesity or aging. In contrast, Ikbkb(Deltamye) mice retain global insulin sensitivity and are protected from insulin resistance. Thus, IKK-beta acts locally in liver and systemically in myeloid cells, where NF-kappaB activation induces inflammatory mediators that cause insulin resistance. These findings demonstrate the importance of liver cell IKK-beta in hepatic insulin resistance and the central role of myeloid cells in development of systemic insulin resistance. We suggest that inhibition of IKK-beta, especially in myeloid cells, may be used to treat insulin resistance.},

title = {The diversity of bioactive proteins in Australian snake venoms},
abstract = {Australian elapid snakes are amongst the most venomous in the world. Their venoms contain multiple components that target blood hemostasis, neuromuscular signaling, and the cardiovascular system. We describe here a comprehensive approach to separation and identification of the venom proteins from 18 of these snake species, representing 9 genera. The venom protein components were separated by 2D PAGE, and identified using mass spectrometry and de novo peptide sequencing. The venoms are complex mixtures showing up to 200 protein spots varying in size from 10. These include many proteins previously identified in Australian snake venoms, homologs identified in other snake species and some novel proteins. In many cases multiple trains of spots were typically observed in the higher molecular weight range (>20 kDa) (indicative of post-translational modification). Venom proteins and their post-translational modifications were characterised using specific antibodies, phosphoprotein and glycoprotein specific stains, enzymatic digestion, lectin binding and antivenom reactivity. In the lower molecular weight range, several proteins were identified but the predominant species were phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and alpha neurotoxins, both represented by different sequence variants. The higher molecular weight range contained proteases, nucleotidases, oxidases and homologs of mammalian coagulation factors. This information together with the identification of several novel proteins (metalloproteinases, vespryns, PLA2 inhibitors, protein disulfide isomerase, 5; nucleotidases, CRISPs, C-type lectins and acetylcholinesterases) aids in understanding the lethal mechanisms of elapid snake venoms and represents a valuable resource for future development of novel human therapeutics.},

Although the database of modified conotoxins is growing rapidly, there are far more questions raised than answers provided about possible mechanisms and functions of posttranslational modifications in Conus.},

abstract = {We show that NF-kappaB and transcriptional targets are activated in liver by obesity and high-fat diet (HFD). We have matched this state of chronic, subacute 'inflammation' by low-level activation of NF-kappaB in the liver of transgenic mice, designated LIKK, by selectively expressing constitutively active IKK-b in hepatocytes. These mice exhibit a type 2 diabetes phenotype, characterized by hyperglycemia, profound hepatic insulin resistance, and moderate systemic insulin resistance, including effects in muscle. The hepatic production of proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, IL-1beta and TNF-alpha, was increased in LIKK mice to a similar extent as induced by HFD in in wild-type mice. Parallel increases were observed in cytokine signaling in liver and mucscle of LIKK mice. Insulin resistance was improved by systemic neutralization of IL-6 or salicylate inhibition of IKK-beta. Hepatic expression of the IkappaBalpha superrepressor (LISR) reversed the phenotype of both LIKK mice and wild-type mice fed an HFD. These findings indicate that lipid accumulation in the liver leads to subacute hepatic 'inflammation' through NF-kappaB activation and downstream cytokine production. This causes insulin resistance both locally in liver and systemically.},

The amino acid sequence of this peptide, named ardiscretin (from arthropod toxin of T. discrepans) was completed by Edman degradation and mass spectrometry. It is a single polypeptide composed by 61 amino acids with an amidated cysteine residue at the C-terminal end, closely packed by four disulfide bridges. The atomic mass unit (a.m.u.) experimentally determined was 7103.8 a.m.u. This peptide was shown to be specific for invertebrates (crickets, triatomides, crabs and squids), but non-toxic to mice, at the dose assayed. Ardiscretin inhibits the Na(+)-currents of squid giant axons in an apparent irreversible manner, whose inhibitory effect is reached at 30 microM toxin concentration. Sequence comparison showed that it is phylogenetically closely related to insect-specific scorpion toxins. Ardiscretin produced a small depolarization and induced repetitive firing in squid axons resembling those of DDT [1,1'(p-chlorobenzyl)2-tricloretane] in its ability to slow down action potential, to induce repetitive firing, and in that the concentration required for any effect in squid axon is rather high.}",

We also evaluated other possible causes of geographic variation in venom using partial Mantel tests and independent contrasts, but rejected both contemporary gene flow (estimated from geographical proximity) and the phylogenetic relationships (assessed by analysis of mitochondrial DNA) among populations as important influences upon venom evolution.

abstract = {Due to their complexity and diversity, animal venoms represent an extensive source of bioactive compounds such as peptides and proteins. Conventional approaches for their characterization often require large quantities of biological material. Current mass spectrometry (MS) techniques now give access to a wealth of information in a short working time frame with minute amounts of sample. Such MS approaches may now be used for the discovery of novel compounds, and once their structure has been determined they may be synthesized and tested for functional activity. Molecular mass fingerprints of venoms allow the rapid identification of known toxins as well as preliminary structural characterization of new compounds. De novo peptide sequencing by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) offers rapid access to partial or total primary peptide structures. This article, written as a tutorial, also contains new material: molecular mass fingerprint analysis of Orthochirus innesi scorpion venom, and identification of components from bumblebee Bombus lapidarius venom, both collected from one single specimen. The structure of the three major peptides detected in the Bombus venom was fully characterized in one working day by de novo sequencing using an electrospray ionization hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight instrument (ESI-QqTOF) and a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight instrument (MALDI-LIFT-TOF-TOF). After presenting the MS-based sequence elucidation, perspectives in using MS and MS/MS techniques in toxinology are discussed.},

abstract = {In a sense, the field of snake venom proteomics has been under investigation since the very earliest biochemical studies where it was soon recognized that venoms are comprised of complex mixtures of bioactive molecules, most of which are proteins. Only with the re-emergence of 2D polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D PAGE) and the recent developments in mass spectrometry for the identification/characterization of proteins coupled with venom gland transcriptomes has the field of snake venom proteomics began to flourish and provide exciting insights into the protein composition of venoms and subsequently their pathological activities. In this manuscript we will briefly discuss the state of snake venom proteomics followed by the presentation of several straightforward experiments designed to explore approaches to investigating venom proteomics. The first set of experiments used 1D gel electrophoresis (1D PAGE) of Crotalus atrox venom followed by slice-by-slice analysis of the proteins using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). In the second set of experiments, C. atrox and Bothrops jararaca venoms were subjected to in-solution digestion followed by Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) LC/MS/MS. The peptide ion-maps of these venoms were compared along with the proteins identified. In addition, the results were compared to the results observed from the 1D PAGE approach. From these studies it is clear that sample de-complexation/fractionation before mass spectrometry is still the best approach for maximum proteome coverage. Furthermore, comparison of venom proteomes based on tryptic peptide identities between the proteomes is not particularly effective since there does not appear to be a sufficient number of such identical peptides, derived from related proteins, present in venoms. Finally, as has previously been recognized without either better databases of venom protein sequences or facile and rapid de novo sequencing technologies for mass spectrometry, snake venom proteome investigation will remain a laborious task.},

SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under non-reducing conditions showed protein bands of approximately 100 kDa specific of male venoms. 2D-electrophoresis showed regions with varying spot complexity between pooled female and male venoms as well as spots that were gender specific. Gelatin zymography showed that female venoms contained proteinases of approximately 25 kDa absent from male venoms. Female venoms were more active than male venoms in degrading fibrinogen whereas on fibrin no significant differences were detected. Among various chromogenic peptide substrates tested, male venoms showed higher amidolytic activity than female venoms on D-Val-Leu-Lys-pNA and D-Phe-Pip-Arg-pNA.

Taking advantage of these methodologies, small peptides with 'newly exploited' biological activities such as vasoactive, hormone-like, antimicrobial and others have been recently given much more attention, enlarging the known repertoire of bioactive molecules found in animal venoms. This article aims to review current knowledge on small biologically active peptides (<3 kDa) found in arthropod venoms and discuss their potentialities as new drug candidates or therapeutic lead compounds.},

title = {Electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization tandem time-of-flight mass spectrometric analyses to solve micro-heterogeneity in post-translationally modified peptides from Phoneutria nigriventer (Aranea, Ctenidae) venom},
abstract = {Previous studies of the fractionated venom of the Brazilian armed spider Phoneutria nigriventer, obtained by gel filtration, have demonstrated the presence of a fraction PhM, a pool of small peptides (up to 2000 Da) that provoke contractions in smooth muscle of guinea pig ileum. Initial attempts to sequence these peptides were largely unsuccessful because of the low purification yield and the fact that the majority seemed to be blocked at their N-termini. In the present work, analysis of this venom fraction by mass spectrometry has revealed the existence of a highly complex mixture of peptides with molecular weights corresponding to those observed for the muscle-active peptides previously described (800-1800 Da). These peptides appear to be a family of isoforms with some particular features. The amino acid sequences of 15 isoforms have been determined by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) using both electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (ESI-Q/ToFMS) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization tandem time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-ToF/ToFMS). These molecules contain post-translational modifications such as proteolysis and C-terminal amidation, which combine to generate additional isoforms. All the isoforms sequenced in this study possess an N-terminal pyroglutamic acid residue. A search for sequence similarities with other peptides in databanks revealed that these peptides are structurally related to the tachykinins, a family of neuro-hormone peptides. The data obtained in this study will be essential for the subsequent steps of this research, the synthesis of these peptides and pharmacological characterization of their biological activity.},

title = "{Characterization of the integrin specificities of disintegrins isolated from American pit viper venoms}",
abstract = "{A new series of homologous disintegrins was isolated from the venoms of new world pit viper genus Bothrops, Crotalus, and Lachesis. The relative activities of each disintegrin in blocking adhesive protein binding activities of GPIIb-IIIa, alpha v beta 3, and alpha 5 beta 1 were determined and correlated with their primary amino acid sequences. Four disintegrins contained the RGDW sequence and were found to be approximately twice as effective in blocking the binding of fibrinogen to GPIIb-IIIa than inhibiting the binding of vitronectin to alpha v beta 3 in solid-phase ligand binding assays (IC50 = 7.3 and 17.2 nM, respectively). A second group of seven disintegrins contained the RGDNP sequence and were found to be more potent inhibitors of vitronectin binding to alpha v beta 3 than fibrinogen binding to GPIIb-IIIa (IC50 = 4.3 and 19 nM, respectively). The RGDNP containing disintegrins were also greater than 10-fold more potent than RGDW containing disintegrins in blocking the adhesion of cells mediated by alpha 5 beta 1. These data illustrate that amino acid sequences immediately adjacent to the RGD site of disintegrins can create an extended RGD locus which coupled with conformational display of the RGD sequence may be involved in determining integrin selectivity and affinity. This information has been used in separate studies to design conformationally constrained integrin antagonists with high affinity for platelet GPIIb-IIIa.}",

abstract = {Cytotoxicity-guided fractionation of the organic extract from a Fijian Lyngbya majuscula led to the discovery of desmethoxymajusculamide C (DMMC) as the active metabolite. Spectroscopic analysis including 1D and 2D NMR, MS/MS, and chemical degradation and derivatization protocols were used to assign the planar structure and stereoconfiguration of this new cyclic depsipeptide. DMMC demonstrated potent and selective anti-solid tumor activity with an IC(50) = 20 nM against the HCT-116 human colon carcinoma cell line via disruption of cellular microfilament networks. A linear form of DMMC was generated by base hydrolysis, and the amino acid sequence was confirmed by mass spectrometry. Linearized DMMC was also evaluated in the biological assays and found to maintain potent actin depolymerization characteristics while displaying solid tumor selectivity equivalent to DMMC in the disk diffusion assay. A clonogenic assay assessing cytotoxicity to HCT-116 cells as a function of exposure duration showed that greater than 24 h of constant drug treatment was required to yield significant cell killing. Therapeutic studies with HCT-116 bearing SCID mice demonstrated efficacy at the highest dose used (%T/C = 60% at 0.62 mg/kg daily for 5 days).},

abstract = {The generation of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from the pit-viper snake Lachesis muta venom glands allowed us to identify two cDNA isoforms which encode the precursors for bradykinin-potentiating peptides (BPPs) and a C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP). The sequence data derived from these cDNAs combined with the venom peptides identification using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis predicted that these molecules are the precursor protein isoforms that are further processed to produce five novel BPPs and a CNP. They were identified directly in crude venom using MALDI-TOF. The BPPs sequences were further confirmed by MALDI-TOF/TOF de novo sequencing, and an unusual BPP with a residue of tryptophan at the N-terminus (usually it is pyroglutamate) was identified. The putative processing steps required to form the mature BPPs and CNP seem to be similar to those proposed for the ones found in the venom of Bothrops jararaca and Glodyus blomhoffi.},

abstract = "{Despite significant research in this area, metastatic breast cancer remains a disease with a poor prognosis. Until an effective therapy is developed, it is imperative that new treatment modalities be investigated. In this report, we describe an effective method for delivery of a novel snake venom disintegrin, contortrostatin (CN), in an orthotopic, xenograft model of human mammary cancer in immunodeficient mice. CN (Mr 13,500) is a homodimeric disintegrin isolated from venom of the Southern Copperhead snake. The homodimer possesses two Arg-Gly-Asp sites, which modulate its interaction with integrins on tumor cells and angiogenic vascular endothelial cells. Although our laboratory has previously described the antitumor activity of CN in a mouse model of human mammary cancer, the method of delivery, daily intratumor injection, was not translatable to clinical application. We now describe a clinically relevant method of administering CN, liposomal delivery (LCN). A unique liposomal system has been designed for i.v. administration of a biologically active protein with full retention of biological activity. Pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, platelet reactivity, and immunogenicity of LCN were determined and compared with similar characteristics of native, unencapsulated CN. There are several advantages to liposomal delivery of CN: (1) LCN has a significantly prolonged circulatory half-life compared with native CN; (2) LCN is passively accumulated in the tumor; (3) LCN has no platelet reactivity; and (4) LCN is not recognized by the immune system. Finally, antiangiogenic activity is an important component of CN's mechanism of antitumor action. We have demonstrated that i.v. delivery of LCN leads to potent antiangiogenic activity in the orthotopic, xenograft human mammary tumor model.}",

title = "{Alpha-fibrinogenases}",
abstract = "{Snake venoms contain a number of serine and metalloproteinases, included among these are the fibrinolytic metalloproteinases. When the fibrinolytic enzymes were first isolated from viper venoms it was postulated that there may be a clinical application for these enzymes in the treatment of occlusive thrombi, such as those occurring in the great arteries and veins of cardiac and cerebral circulation as well as peripheral arteries and veins. In the ensuing years a substantial body of literature has been generated on the identification and characterization of the fibrinolytic enzymes from a broad spectrum of snake species. In this report we describe the biological properties and positive clinical features of the class of enzymes known as alpha-fibrinogenases. Fibrolase, a fibrinolytic metalloproteinase originally isolated from Agkistrodon contortrix contortrix venom, is the representative fibrinolytic enzyme used for the description and characterization of the alpha-fibrinogenases in this chapter. The biochemical and physiochemical properties and in vivo activity of the enzyme are described as well as in vitro studies using a platelet avid chimera of fibrolase. The chimera was formed by coupling fibrolase to an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) like peptide imparting inhibitory activity on platelet aggregation and thrombus formation, while maintaining full fibrinolytic activity. Fibrolase has also been modified through the adduction of polyethylene glycol to reduce the rate of clearance from the circulation. In this review we also include a description of alfimeprase, a recombinant fibrinolytic enzyme derived from fibrolase, and follow the development of the enzyme as a potential clinical agent in the clearance of occlusive thrombi. Alfimeprase is presently in clinical trials for two indications: the treatment of peripheral arterial occlusions (in which phase II is nearing successful completion), and for use in the clearance of occluded vascular access catheters in direct competition with plasminogen activators.}",

title = {Fast analysis of low molecular mass compounds present in snake venom: identification of ten new pyroglutamate-containing peptides},
abstract = {Characterization of the peptide content in snake venoms can be an important tool for the investigation of new pharmacological lead compounds. For this purpose, single-step analysis of crude venoms has recently been demonstrated using mass spectrometry (MS) techniques. Reproducible profiles of ions in MS and MS/MS spectra may also be used to compare venoms from different species. In this work matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOFMS) was used to obtain mass patterns of the major peptides (<8 kDa) found in pooled venoms from the genera Bothrops and Crotalus. Venoms from five different Bothrops species (B. jararaca, B. insularis, B. alternatus, B. jararacussu, and B. neuwiedi) and three Crotalus species (C. viridis, C. adamanteus and C. durissus terrificus) were analyzed. In agreement with other reports, venoms from Bothrops species contained a variety of peptides in the range m/z 1000-1500, and in some samples larger components (m/z 7000-8000) were detected. In the Crotalus species venoms were rich in peptides ranging from m/z 1000-1500 and 4000-5500. MS/MS experiments on the low molecular mass peptides (m/z 1000-1500) confirmed the presence of ten new bradykinin-potentiating peptides among venoms from genera Bothrops and Crotalus. In order to determine whether additional peptides could be identified after partial purification, B. jararaca venom was subjected to size-exclusion chromatography on Sephacryl S-200, and two distinct low molecular mass pools were analyzed further by MALDI-TOFMS. No additional peptides were detected from the pool with masses below 2000 Da but a substantial improvement with better resolution was observed for the pool with masses above 7000 Da, indicating that complex samples such as crude snake venoms can be analyzed for low molecular mass peptides using a single-step procedure.},

The sequence of the N-terminal 22 amino acid residues was determined by Edman degradation. Using this sequence information, the full-length cDNA and genomic gene of BmSKTx1 were cloned and sequenced. By these analyses, BmSKTx1 was found to be a peptide composed of 31 amino acid residues with three disulfide bonds. It shared little sequence homology with other known scorpion alpha-KTxs but showed close relationship with SK channel blockers in the phylogenetic tree. According to the previous nomenclature, BmSKTx1 was classified as alpha-KTx14.1. We examined the effects of BmSKTx1 on different ion channels of rat adrenal chromaffin cells (RACC) and locust dorsal unpaired median (DUM) neurons. BmSKTx1 selectively inhibited apamin-sensitive SK currents in RACC with Kd of 0.72 microM and Hill coefficient of 2.2. And it had no effect on Na+, Ca2+, Kv, and BK currents in DUM neuron, indicating that BmSKTx1 was a selective SK toxin.}",

abstract = {A 50 kDa protein that inhibits platelet adhesion to collagen has been isolated from snake venom of Crotalus atrox (western diamondback rattlesnake) and has been named 'catrocollastatin'. The cDNA cloning of catrocollastatin has been accomplished. A full-length cDNA of 2310 bp with an open reading frame between nucleotides 51 and 1880 was obtained. The deduced amino acid sequence consists of 609 amino acids. The cDNA-predicted amino acid sequence is highly similar to that of haemorrhagic metalloproteinase jararhagin from Bothrops jararaca venom, HR1B from Trimeresurus flavoviridis, Ht-e from C. atrox and trigramin from T. gramineus. Like jararhagin and HR1B, catrocollastatin is a multidomain molecule composed of an N-terminal domain, a metalloproteinase domain, a disintegrin-like domain and a cysteine-rich C-terminal domain. In the disintegrin-like domain, the frequently seen RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) sequence is replaced by SECD (Ser-Glu-Cys-Asp). This cDNA was expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda (fall armyworm) (Sf9) insect cells using a baculovirus expression system. Like native catrocollastatin, the expressed protein is capable of selectively blocking collagen-induced platelet aggregation. This is the first full-length clone of a high-molecular-mass haemorrhagin to be expressed.},

The purified peptide elicited toxic effects in the freshwater snail Pomacea paludosa after intramuscular injection, but it had no effect when injected intracerebrally into mice. The structural similarity of peptide as7a to other gamma-conotoxins suggests that modulation of pacemaker channels could be responsible for its biological activity.},
