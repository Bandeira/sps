abstract = {The BLAST programs are widely used tools for searching protein and DNA databases for sequence similarities. For protein comparisons, a variety of definitional, algorithmic and statistical refinements described here permits the execution time of the BLAST programs to be decreased substantially while enhancing their sensitivity to weak similarities. A new criterion for triggering the extension of word hits, combined with a new heuristic for generating gapped alignments, yields a gapped BLAST program that runs at approximately three times the speed of the original. In addition, a method is introduced for automatically combining statistically significant alignments produced by BLAST into a position-specific score matrix, and searching the database using this matrix. The resulting Position-Specific Iterated BLAST (PSI-BLAST) program runs at approximately the same speed per iteration as gapped BLAST, but in many cases is much more sensitive to weak but biologically relevant sequence similarities. PSI-BLAST is used to uncover several new and interesting members of the BRCT superfamily.},

abstract = {Almost all protein database search methods use amino acid substitution matrices for scoring, optimizing, and assessing the statistical significance of sequence alignments. Much care and effort has therefore gone into constructing substitution matrices, and the quality of search results can depend strongly upon the choice of the proper matrix. A long-standing problem has been the comparison of sequences with biased amino acid compositions, for which standard substitution matrices are not optimal. To address this problem, we have recently developed a general procedure for transforming a standard matrix into one appropriate for the comparison of two sequences with arbitrary, and possibly differing compositions. Such adjusted matrices yield, on average, improved alignments and alignment scores when applied to the comparison of proteins with markedly biased compositions. Here we review the application of compositionally adjusted matrices and consider whether they may also be applied fruitfully to general purpose protein sequence database searches, in which related sequence pairs do not necessarily have strong compositional biases. Although it is not advisable to apply compositional adjustment indiscriminately, we describe several simple criteria under which invoking such adjustment is on average beneficial. In a typical database search, at least one of these criteria is satisfied by over half the related sequence pairs. Compositional substitution matrix adjustment is now available in NCBI's protein-protein version of blast.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: The key to MS -based proteomics is peptide sequencing. The major challenge in peptide sequencing, whether library search or de novo, is to better infer statistical significance and better attain noise reduction. Since the noise in a spectrum depends on experimental conditions, the instrument used and many other factors, it cannot be predicted even if the peptide sequence is known. The characteristics of the noise can only be uncovered once a spectrum is given. We wish to overcome such issues. RESULTS: We designed RAId to identify peptides from their associated tandem mass spectrometry data. RAId performs a novel de novo sequencing followed by a search in a peptide library that we created. Through de novo sequencing, we establish the spectrum-specific background score statistics for the library search. When the database search fails to return significant hits, the top-ranking de novo sequences become potential candidates for new peptides that are not yet in the database. The use of spectrum-specific background statistics seems to enable RAId to perform well even when the spectral quality is marginal. Other important features of RAId include its potential in de novo sequencing alone and the ease of incorporating post-translational modifications.},

In this work, we propose a new method to distinguish between these two amino acids in consecutive MSn experiments, exploiting a gas-phase fragmentation of isoleucine that leads to a diagnostic 69 Da ion. We used this method to assess the Leu/Ile residues of several synthetic peptides. The procedure was then tested on a tryptic digest of myoglobin, assigning the correct amino acid in the majority of the peptides. This work was performed with an old and low-resolution instrument, thus demonstrating that our method is suitable for a wide number of ion trap mass spectrometers, not necessarily expensive or up-to-date.},

abstract = {A new strategy is described for the determination of amino acid sequences of unknown peptides. Different from the well-known but often inefficient de novo sequencing approach, the new method is based on a two-step process. In the first step the amino acid composition of an unknown peptide is determined on the basis of accurate mass values of the peptide precursor ion and a small number of accurate fragment ion mass values, and, as in de novo sequencing, without employing protein database information or other pre-information. In the second step the sequence of the found amino acids of the peptide is determined by scoring the agreement between expected and observed fragment ion signals of the permuted sequences. It was found that the new approach is highly efficient if accurate mass values are available and that it easily outstrips common approaches of de novo sequencing being based on lower accuracies and detailed knowledge of fragmentation behavior. Simple permutation and calculation of all possible amino acid sequences, however, is only efficient if the composition is known or if possible compositions are at least reduced to a small list. The latter requires the highest possible instrumental mass accuracy, which is currently provided only by fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry. The connection between mass accuracy and peptide composition variability is described and an example of peptide compositioning and composition-based sequencing is presented.},

abstract = {Proteomics, or the direct analysis of the expressed protein components of a cell, is critical to our understanding of cellular biological processes in normal and diseased tissue. A key requirement for its success is the ability to identify proteins in complex mixtures. Recent technological advances in tandem mass spectrometry has made it the method of choice for high-throughput identification of proteins. Unfortunately, the software for unambiguously identifying peptide sequences has not kept pace with the recent hardware improvements in mass spectrometry instruments. Critical for reliable high-throughput protein identification, scoring functions evaluate the quality of a match between experimental spectra and a database peptide. Current scoring function technology relies heavily on ad-hoc parameterization and manual curation by experienced mass spectrometrists. In this work, we propose a two-stage stochastic model for the observed MS/MS spectrum, given a peptide. Our model explicitly incorporates fragment ion probabilities, noisy spectra, and instrument measurement error. We describe how to compute this probability based score efficiently, using a dynamic programming technique. A prototype implementation demonstrates the effectiveness of the model.},

The corresponding algorithmic problem is to cluster multicondition gene expression patterns. In this paper we describe a novel clustering algorithm that was developed for analysis of gene expression data. We define an appropriate stochastic error model on the input, and prove that under the conditions of the model, the algorithm recovers the cluster structure with high probability. The running time of the algorithm on an n-gene dataset is O[n2[log(n)]c]. We also present a practical heuristic based on the same algorithmic ideas. The heuristic was implemented and its performance is demonstrated on simulated data and on real gene expression data, with very promising results.},

Here we show using deuterium exchange/mass spectrometry coupled with hydrodynamic measures that CENP-A and histone H4 form sub-nucleosomal tetramers that are more compact and conformationally more rigid than the corresponding tetramers of histones H3 and H4. Substitution into histone H3 of the domain of CENP-A responsible for compaction is sufficient to direct it to centromeres. Thus, the centromere-targeting domain of CENP-A confers a unique structural rigidity to the nucleosomes into which it assembles, and is likely to have a role in maintaining centromere identity.},

abstract = {The structure of an AKAP docked to the dimerization/docking (D/D) domain of the type II (RIIalpha) isoform of protein kinase A (PKA) has been well characterized, but there currently is no detailed structural information of an AKAP docked to the type I (RIalpha) isoform. Dual-specific AKAP2 (D-AKAP2) binds in the nanomolar range to both isoforms and provided us with an opportunity to characterize the isoform-selective nature of AKAP binding using a common docked ligand. Hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange combined with mass spectrometry (DXMS) was used to probe backbone structural changes of an alpha-helical A-kinase binding (AKB) motif from D-AKAP2 docked to both RIalpha and RIIalpha D/D domains. The region of protection upon complex formation and the magnitude of protection from H/D exchange were determined for both interacting partners in each complex. The backbone of the AKB ligand was more protected when bound to RIalpha compared to RIIalpha, suggesting an increased helical stabilization of the docked AKB ligand. This combined with a broader region of backbone protection induced by the AKAP on the docking surface of RIalpha indicated that there were more binding constraints for the AKB ligand when bound to RIalpha. This was in contrast to RIIalpha, which has a preformed, localized binding surface. These distinct modes of AKAP binding may contribute to the more discriminating nature of the RIalpha AKAP-docking surface. DXMS provides valuable structural information for understanding binding specificity in the absence of a high-resolution structure, and can readily be applied to other protein-ligand and protein-protein interactions.},

Here we describe an integrated strategy for systematic proteome analysis based on differential guanidination of C-terminal lysine residues on tryptic peptides followed by capillary liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry. The approach, termed mass-coded abundance tagging (MCAT), facilitates the automated, large-scale, and comprehensive de novo determination of peptide sequence and relative quantitation of proteins in biological samples in a single analysis. MCAT offers marked advantages as compared with previously described methods and is simple, economic, and effective when applied to complex proteomic mixtures. MCAT is used to identify proteins, including polymorphic variants, from complex mixtures and measure variation in protein levels from diverse cell types.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to determine if liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC/MS) data of tryptic digests of proteins can be used for quantitation. In theory, the peak area of peptides should correlate to their concentration; hence, the peak areas of peptides from one protein should correlate to the concentration of that particular protein. To evaluate this hypothesis, different amounts of tryptic digests of myoglobin were analyzed by LC/MS in a wide range between 10 fmol and 100 pmol. The results show that the peak areas from liquid chromatography mass spectrometry correlate linearly to the concentration of the protein (r2 = 0.991). The method was further evaluated by adding two different concentrations of horse myoglobin to human serum. The results confirm that the quantitation method can also be used for quantitative profiling of proteins in complex mixtures such as human sera. Expected and calculated protein ratios differ by no more than 16\%. We describe a new method combining protein identification with accurate profiling of individual proteins. This approach should provide a widely applicable means to compare global protein expression in biological samples.},

abstract = {Peptide sequencing using tandem mass spectrometry data is an important and challenging problem in proteomics. We address the problem of peptide sequencing for multi-charge spectra. Most peptide sequencing algorithms currently consider only charge one or two ions even for higher-charge spectra. We give a characterization of multi-charge spectra by generalizing existing models. Using our models, we analyzed spectra from Global Proteome Machine (GPM) [Craig R, Cortens JP, Beavis RC, J Proteome Res 3:1234-1242, 2004.] (with charges 1-5), Institute for Systems Biology (ISB) [Keller A, Purvine S, Nesvizhskii AI, Stolyar S, Goodlett DR, Kolker E, OMICS 6:207-212, 2002.] and Orbitrap (both with charges 1-3). Our analysis for the GPM dataset shows that higher charge peaks contribute significantly to prediction of the complete peptide. They also help to explain why existing algorithms do not perform well on multi-charge spectra. Based on these analyses, we claim that peptide sequencing algorithms can achieve higher sensitivity results if they also consider higher charge ions. We verify this claim by proposing a de novo sequencing algorithm called the greedy best strong tag (GBST) algorithm that is simple but considers higher charge ions based on our new model. Evaluation on multi-charge spectra shows that our simple GBST algorithm outperforms Lutefisk and PepNovo, especially for the GPM spectra of charge three or more.},

Crosslinking studies can estimate the proximity of proteins, determine sites of protein-protein interactions, and have the potential to provide a snapshot of dynamic interactions by covalently locking them in place for analysis. Several major challenges are associated with the use of crosslinkers in mass spectrometry, particularly in complex mixtures. We describe the synthesis and characterization of a MS-cleavable crosslinker containing cyclic amines, which address some of these challenges. The DC4 crosslinker contains two intrinsic positive charges, which allow crosslinked peptides to fragment into their component peptides by collision-induced dissociation (CID) or in-source decay. Initial fragmentation events result in cleavage on either side of the positive charges so crosslinked peptides are identified as pairs of ions separated by defined masses. The structures of the component peptides can then be robustly determined by MS(3) because their fragmentation products rearrange to generate a mobile proton. The DC4 crosslinking reagent is stable to storage, highly reactive, highly soluble (1 M solutions), quite labile to CID, and MS(3) results in productive backbone fragmentation.},

The remaining cleavage sites occurring in human betaB1 did not closely match those occurring in other species, possibly due to the widely divergent amino acid sequence of the N-terminal extension of betaB1 amoung species. Results from animal models suggest that cleavage of the N-terminal extension of betaB1-crystallin could enhance protein insolubilization and cataract in lens.

We show that intact proteins that are differentially alkylated with acrylamide (+71 Da) versus iodoacetamide (+57 Da) have substantial chromatographic shifts during reversed-phase liquid chromatography separation (particularly in peak tails), indicating a requirement for stable isotopes in alkylation tags for top-down MS. In the (14)N/(15)N metabolic labeling strategy, we achieve 98\% (15)N incorporation in yeast grown 10 generations under aerobic conditions and determine 50 expression ratios using Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance MS in comparing these cells to anaerobically grown control ((14)N) cells. We devise quantitative methods for top-down analyses, including a correction factor for accurate protein ratio determination based upon the signal-to-noise ratio. Using a database of 200 yeast protein forms identified previously by top-down MS, we verify the intact mass tag concept for protein identification without tandem MS. Overall, we find that top-down MS promises work flows capable of large-scale proteome profiling using stable isotope labeling and the determination of >5 protein ratios per spectrum.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Due to the recent advances in technology of mass spectrometry, there has been an exponential increase in the amount of data being generated in the past few years. Database searches have not been able to keep with this data explosion. Thus, speeding up the data searches becomes increasingly important in mass-spectrometry-based applications. Traditional database search methods use one-against-all comparisons of a query spectrum against a very large number of peptides generated from in silico digestion of protein sequences in a database, to filter potential candidates from this database followed by a detailed scoring and ranking of those filtered candidates. RESULTS: In this article, we show that we can avoid the one-against-all comparisons. The basic idea is to design a set of hash functions to pre-process peptides in the database such that for each query spectrum we can use the hash functions to find only a small subset of peptide sequences that are most likely to match the spectrum. The construction of each hash function is based on a random spectrum and the hash value of a peptide is the normalized shared peak counts score (cosine) between the random spectrum and the hypothetical spectrum of the peptide. To implement this idea, we first embed each peptide into a unit vector in a high-dimensional metric space. The random spectrum is represented by a random vector, and we use random vectors to construct a set of hash functions called locality sensitive hashing (LSH) for preprocessing. We demonstrate that our mapping is accurate. We show that our method can filter out >95.65\% of the spectra without missing any correct sequences, or gain 111 times speedup by filtering out 99.64\% of spectra while missing at most 0.19\% (2 out of 1014) of the correct sequences. In addition, we show that our method can be effectively used for other mass spectra mining applications such as finding clusters of spectra efficiently and accurately.

Although the acquisition of tandem mass spectra is not biased toward well-understood protein isoforms, this computational strategy is failing to identify peptides from alternative splicing and coding SNP protein isoforms despite the acquisition of good-quality tandem mass spectra. We propose, instead, that expressed sequence tags (ESTs) be searched. Ordinarily, such a strategy would be computationally infeasible due to the size of EST sequence databases; however, we show that a sophisticated sequence database compression strategy, applied to human ESTs, reduces the sequence database size approximately 35-fold. Once compressed, our EST sequence database is comparable in size to other commonly used protein sequence databases, making routine EST searching feasible. We demonstrate that our EST sequence database enables the discovery of novel peptides in a variety of public data sets.},

Widely used algorithms do not fully exploit the intensity patterns present in mass spectra. Here, we demonstrate that intensity pattern modeling improves peptide and protein identification from MS/MS spectra. We modeled fragment ion intensities using a machine-learning approach that estimates the likelihood of observed intensities given peptide and fragment attributes. From 1,000,000 spectra, we chose 27,000 with high-quality, nonredundant matches as training data. Using the same 27,000 spectra, intensity was similarly modeled with mismatched peptides. We used these two probabilistic models to compute the relative likelihood of an observed spectrum given that a candidate peptide is matched or mismatched. We used a 'decoy' proteome approach to estimate incorrect match frequency, and demonstrated that an intensity-based method reduces peptide identification error by 50-96\% without any loss in sensitivity.},

abstract = {Covalent modification of proteins by small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) regulates various cellular activities in yeast and mammalian cells. In Arabidopsis, inactivation of genes encoding SUMO or SUMO-conjugation enzymes is lethal, emphasizing the importance of SUMOylation in plant development. Despite this, little is known about SUMO targets in plants. Here we identified 238 Arabidopsis proteins as potential SUMO substrates because they interacted with SUMO-conjugating enzyme and/or SUMO protease (ESD4) in the yeast two-hybrid system. Compared with the whole Arabidopsis proteome, the identified proteins were strongly enriched for those containing high-probability consensus SUMO attachment sites, further supporting that they are true SUMO substrates. A high-throughput assay was developed in Escherichia coli and used to test the SUMOylation of 56\% of these proteins. More than 92\% of the proteins tested were SUMOylated in this assay by at least one SUMO isoform. Furthermore, ADA2b, an ESD4 interactor that was SUMOylated in the E. coli system, also was shown to be SUMOylated in Arabidopsis. The identified SUMO substrates are involved in a wide range of plant processes, many of which were not previously known to involve SUMOylation. These proteins provide a basis for exploring the function of SUMOylation in the regulation of diverse processes in Arabidopsis.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Comparing tandem mass spectra (MSMS) against a known dataset of protein sequences is a common method for identifying unknown proteins; however, the processing of MSMS by current software often limits certain applications, including comprehensive coverage of post-translational modifications, non-specific searches and real-time searches to allow result-dependent instrument control. This problem deserves attention as new mass spectrometers provide the ability for higher throughput and as known protein datasets rapidly grow in size. New software algorithms need to be devised in order to address the performance issues of conventional MSMS protein dataset-based protein identification. METHODS: This paper describes a novel algorithm based on converting a collection of monoisotopic, centroided spectra to a new data structure, named 'peptide finite state machine' (PFSM), which may be used to rapidly search a known dataset of protein sequences, regardless of the number of spectra searched or the number of potential modifications examined. The algorithm is verified using a set of commercially available tryptic digest protein standards analyzed using an ABI 4700 MALDI TOFTOF mass spectrometer, and a free, open source PFSM implementation. It is illustrated that a PFSM can accurately search large collections of spectra against large datasets of protein sequences (e.g. NCBI nr) using a regular desktop PC; however, this paper only details the method for identifying peptide and subsequently protein candidates from a dataset of known protein sequences. The concept of using a PFSM as a peptide pre-screening technique for MSMS-based search engines is validated by using PFSM with Mascot and XTandem. AVAILABILITY: Complete source code, documentation and examples for the reference PFSM implementation are freely available at the Proteome Commons, http://www.proteomecommons.org and source code may be used both commercially and non-commercially as long as the original authors are credited for their work.},

Laureates John B. Fenn, Koichi Tanaka (MS) and Kurt W�thrich (NMR) have pioneered the successful application of their techniques to biological macromolecules. Biological macromolecules are the main actors in the makeup of life whether expressed in prospering diversity or in threatening disease. To understand biology and medicine at molecular level where the identity, functional characteristics, structural architecture and specific interactions of biomolecules are the basis of life, we need to visualize the activity and interplay of large macromolecules such as proteins. To study, or analyse, the protein molecules, principles for their separation and determination of their individual characteristics had to be developed. Two of the most important chemical techniques used today for the analysis of biomolecules are mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), the subjects of this year�s Nobel Prize award.},

abstract = {SeqMS, a software program designed for the automated interpretation of high-energy collision-induced dissociation (CID) mass spectra of singly protonated peptides ionized by fast atom bombardment, has been developed. The software is capable of probing the sequence of an unknown peptide, and even of certain modified peptides. The program, compiled for WINDOWS95 or NT, also permits the retrieval of raw data and the reconstruction of the spectra on a user-friendly graphical interface with the aid of several tools for processing the spectra, which include setting multiple threshold levels and automatic peak detection. SeqMS is capable of generating candidate sequences, based on the detected peaks, and of displaying the resulting assignments for each candidate in a spectrum or in tabular form. The software has the following capabilities: 1) the ions derived from backbone and side-chain fragmentations, internal and immonium ions, and side-chain loss ions can be used for calculation; 2) 18O-labeling of a peptide at the C terminus, a methodology which was developed to differentiate N-terminal from C-terminal ions, is applicable as an optional setting; 3) modified amino acids and N- or C-terminal blocking groups are taken into account for calculation according to the user's setting in a library; 4) amino acid composition and partial or complete amino acid sequence of a peptide can be used as input for calculation; 5) the assignments of signal output in a spectrum can be graphically edited, and then re-calculated based on the edited peaks. The efficacy of the program is demonstrated by testing 74 high-energy CID spectra, obtained using a four-sector instrument, of synthetic, proteolytic, and biologically active peptides, some of which contain modified groups.},

abstract = {Protein kinase A (PKA), a central locus for cAMP signaling in the cell, is composed of regulatory (R) and catalytic (C) subunits. The C-subunits are maintained in an inactive state by binding to the R-subunit dimer in a tetrameric holoenzyme complex (R(2)C(2)). PKA is activated by cAMP binding to the R-subunits which induces a conformational change leading to release of the active C-subunit. Enzymatic activity of the C-subunit is thus regulated by cAMP via the R-subunit, which toggles between cAMP and C-subunit bound states. The R-subunit is composed of a dimerization/docking (D/D) domain connected to two cAMP-binding domains (cAMP:A and cAMP:B). While crystal structures of the free C-subunit and cAMP-bound states of a deletion mutant of the R-subunit are known, there is no structure of the holoenzyme complex or of the cAMP-free state of the R-subunit. An important step in understanding the cAMP-dependent activation of PKA is to map the R-C interface and characterize the mutually exclusive interactions of the R-subunit with cAMP and C-subunit. Amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry is a suitable method that has provided insights into the different states of the R-subunit in solution, thereby allowing mapping of the effects of cAMP and C-subunit on different regions of the R-subunit. Our study has localized interactions with the C-subunit to a small contiguous surface on the cAMP:A domain and the linker region. In addition, C-subunit binding causes increased amide hydrogen exchange within both cAMP-domains, suggesting that these regions become more flexible in the holoenzyme and are primed to bind cAMP. Furthermore, the difference in the protection patterns between RIalpha and the previously studied RIIbeta upon cAMP-binding suggests isoform-specific differences in cAMP-dependent regulation of PKA activity.},

While information is unfolding regarding specific binding motifs, very little is known about the overall structure and dynamics of these scaffold proteins. We have used deuterium exchange-mass spectrometry (DXMS) and limited proteolysis to probe the folded regions of D-AKAP2, providing for the first time insight into the intra-domain dynamics of a scaffold protein. Deuterium on-exchange revealed two regions of low deuterium exchange that were surrounded by regions of high exchange, suggestive of two distinctly folded regions, flanked by disordered or solvent accessible regions. Similar folded regions were detected by limited proteolysis. The first folded region contained a putative regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) domain. A structural model of the RGS domain revealed that the more deuterated regions mapped onto loops and turns, whereas less deuterated regions mapped onto alpha-helices, consistent with this region folding into an RGS domain. The second folded region contained a highly protected PKA binding site and a more solvent-accessible PDZ binding motif, which may serve as a potential targeting domain for D-AKAP2. DXMS has verified the multi-domain architecture of D-AKAP2 implied by sequence homology and has provided unique insight into the accessibility of the PKA binding site.},

abstract = {cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cAPK) is a key component in numerous cell signaling pathways. The cAPK regulatory (R) subunit maintains the kinase in an inactive state until cAMP saturation of the R-subunit leads to activation of the enzyme. To delineate the conformational changes associated with cAPK activation, the amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange in the cAPK type IIbeta R-subunit was probed by electrospray mass spectrometry. Three states of the R-subunit, cAMP-bound, catalytic (C)-subunit bound, and apo, were incubated in deuterated water for various lengths of time and then, prior to mass spectrometry analysis, subjected to digestion by pepsin to localize the deuterium incorporation. High sequence coverage (>99\%) by the pepsin-digested fragments enables us to monitor the dynamics of the whole protein. The effects of cAMP binding on RIIbeta amide hydrogen exchange are restricted to the cAMP-binding pockets, while the effects of C-subunit binding are evident across both cAMP-binding domains and the linker region. The decreased amide hydrogen exchange for residues 253-268 within cAMP binding domain A and for residues 102-115, which include the pseudosubstrate inhibitory site, support the prediction that these two regions represent the conserved primary and peripheral C-subunit binding sites. An increase in amide hydrogen exchange for a broad area within cAMP-binding domain B and a narrow area within cAMP-binding domain A (residues 222-232) suggest that C-subunit binding transmits long-distance conformational changes throughout the protein.},

If the de novo sequencing gives correct tags, the homologs of the proteins can be identified by this approach and software such as MS-BLAST is available for the matching. However, de novo sequencing very often gives only partially correct tags. The most common error is that a segment of amino acids is replaced by another segment with approximately the same masses. We developed a new efficient algorithm to match sequence tags with errors to database sequences for the purpose of protein and peptide identification.

Methods: Genotyping for SUMO4 polymorphisms at G-847A, A-504G, A+163G, and C+438T loci was performed on 231 VKH patients and 302 controls using polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism. Results: A decreased frequency of SUMO4 +438 TT genotype was found in VKH patients compared with healthy controls (p=0.009). However, the significance was lost after Bonferroni correction. Human leukocyte antigens (HLA)-DR4 and HLA-DRw53 were significantly associated with susceptibility to VKH syndrome (p=3.211016 and 7.08105, respectively). Stratification analysis based on HLA-DR4 and HLA-DRw53 did not show any associations between SUMO4 polymorphisms and VKH syndrome, although there was a big difference in the percentage of certain allele and genotype frequencies between HLA-DRw53 negative patients and controls. There was no significance in clinical findings and gender stratification analysis. Conclusions: HLA-DR4 and HLA-DRw53 are strongly associated with the susceptibility to VKH syndrome in the Chinese Han population. However, none of the currently known single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of SUMO4 are associated with this syndrome.},

abstract = {Data mining was performed on 28 330 unique peptide tandem mass spectra for which sequences were assigned with high confidence. By dividing the spectra into different sets based on structural features and charge states of the corresponding peptides, chemical interactions involved in promoting specific cleavage patterns in gas-phase peptides were characterized. Pairwise fragmentation maps describing cleavages at all Xxx-Zzz residue combinations for b and y ions reveal that the difference in basicity between Arg and Lys results in different dissociation patterns for singly charged Arg- and Lys-ending tryptic peptides. While one dominant protonation form (proton localized) exists for Arg-ending peptides, a heterogeneous population of different protonated forms or more facile interconversion of protonated forms (proton partially mobile) exists for Lys-ending peptides. Cleavage C-terminal to acidic residues dominates spectra from singly charged peptides that have a localized proton and cleavage N-terminal to Pro dominates those that have a mobile or partially mobile proton. When Pro is absent from peptides that have a mobile or partially mobile proton, cleavage at each peptide bond becomes much more prominent. Whether the above patterns can be found in b ions, y ions, or both depends on the location of the proton holder(s) in multiply protonated peptides. Enhanced cleavages C-terminal to branched aliphatic residues (Ile, Val, Leu) are observed in both b and y ions from peptides that have a mobile proton, as well as in y ions from peptides that have a partially mobile proton; enhanced cleavages N-terminal to these residues are observed in b ions from peptides that have a partially mobile proton. Statistical tools have been designed to visualize the fragmentation maps and measure the similarity between them. The pairwise cleavage patterns observed expand our knowledge of peptide gas-phase fragmentation behaviors and may be useful in algorithm development that employs improved models to predict fragment ion intensities.},

abstract = {High throughput protein analysis (i.e., proteomics) first became possible when sensitive peptide mass mapping techniques were developed, thereby allowing for the possibility of identifying and cataloging most 2D gel electrophoresis spots. Shortly thereafter a few groups pioneered the idea of identifying proteins by using peptide tandem mass spectra to search protein sequence databases. Hence, it became possible to identify proteins from very complex mixtures. One drawback to these latter techniques is that it is not entirely straightforward to make matches using tandem mass spectra of peptides that are modified or have sequences that differ slightly from what is present in the sequence database that is being searched. This has been part of the motivation behind automated de novo sequencing programs that attempt to derive a peptide sequence regardless of its presence in a sequence database. The sequence candidates thus generated are then subjected to homology-based database search programs (e.g., BLAST or FASTA). These homology search programs, however, were not developed with mass spectrometry in mind, and it became necessary to make minor modifications such that mass spectrometric ambiguities can be taken into account when comparing query and database sequences. Finally, this review will discuss the important issue of validating protein identifications. All of the search programs will produce a top ranked answer; however, only the credulous are willing to accept them carte blanche.},

abstract = {A method is presented for the rapid detection and characterization of trace amounts of peptides secreted from microorganisms, including pheromones, virulence factors, and quorum-sensing peptides. The procedure, based on targeted multistage MS, uses a novel matrix-assisted laser desorptionionization-ion trap mass spectrometer to overcome limitations of current MS methods (limited dynamic range, signal suppression effects, and chemical noise) that impair observation of low abundance peptides from complex biological matrixes. Here, secreted peptides that are hypothesized to be present in the supernatant, but that may not be sufficiently abundant to be observed in single-stage mass spectra, are subjected to multistage MS. Highly specific fragmentation signatures enable unambiguous identification of the peptides of interest and differentiation of the signals from the background. As examples, we demonstrate the rapid (<1 min) determination of the mating type of cells in colonies of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the elucidation of autoinducing peptides (AIPs) from supernatants of pathogenic Staphylococci. We confirm the primary structures of the agrD encoded cyclic AIPs of Staphylococcus aureus for groups I, II, and IV and provide direct evidence that the native group-III AIP is a heptapeptide (INCDFLL). We also show that the homologous peptide from Staphylococcus intermedius is a nonapeptide (RIPTSTGFF) with a lactone ring formed through condensation of the serine side chain with the C terminus of the peptide. This is the first demonstration of cyclization in a staphylococcal AIP that occurs via lactone formation. These examples demonstrate the analytical power of the present procedure for characterizing secreted peptides and its potential utility for identifying microorganisms.},

Using SEQUEST search results for spectra generated from a sample of known protein components, we demonstrate that the computed probabilities are accurate and have high power to discriminate between correctly and incorrectly assigned peptides.

We generated transgenic mice that overexpress the human disease-associated K8 Gly61-to-Cys (G61C) variant and showed that G61C predisposes to liver injury and apoptosis and dramatically inhibits K8 phosphorylation at serine 73 (S73) via stress-activated kinases. This led us to generate mice that overexpress K8 S73-to-Ala (S73A), which mimicked the susceptibility of K8 G61C mice to injury, thereby providing a molecular link between K8 phosphorylation and disease-associated mutation. Upon apoptotic stimulation, G61C and S73A hepatocytes have persistent and increased nonkeratin proapoptotic substrate phosphorylation by stress-activated kinases, compared with wild-type hepatocytes, in association with an inability to phosphorylate K8 S73. Our findings provide the first direct link between patient-related human keratin variants and liver disease predisposition. The highly abundant cytoskeletal protein K8, and possibly other keratins with the conserved S73-containing phosphoepitope, can protect tissue from injury by serving as a phosphate "sponge" for stress-activated kinases and thereby provide a novel nonmechanical function for intermediate filament proteins.},

abstract = {Homotypic and heterotypic protein interactions are crucial for all levels of cellular function, including architecture, regulation, metabolism, and signaling. Therefore, protein interaction maps represent essential components of post-genomic toolkits needed for understanding biological processes at a systems level. Over the past decade, a wide variety of methods have been developed to detect, analyze, and quantify protein interactions, including surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy, NMR, yeast two-hybrid screens, peptide tagging combined with mass spectrometry and fluorescence-based technologies. Fluorescence techniques range from co-localization of tags, which may be limited by the optical resolution of the microscope, to fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based methods that have molecular resolution and can also report on the dynamics and localization of the interactions within a cell. Proteins interact via highly evolved complementary surfaces with affinities that can vary over many orders of magnitude. Some of the techniques described in this review, such as surface plasmon resonance, provide detailed information on physical properties of these interactions, while others, such as two-hybrid techniques and mass spectrometry, are amenable to high-throughput analysis using robotics. In addition to providing an overview of these methods, this review emphasizes techniques that can be applied to determine interactions involving membrane proteins, including the split ubiquitin system and fluorescence-based technologies for characterizing hits obtained with high-throughput approaches. Mass spectrometry-based methods are covered by a review by Miernyk and Thelen (2008; this issue, pp. 597-609). In addition, we discuss the use of interaction data to construct interaction networks and as the basis for the exciting possibility of using to predict interaction surfaces.},

The most commonly used reagents are iodoacetic acid and iodoacetamide, which increase the molecular mass of the protein by 58 or 57 Da, respectively, for each derivatized cysteine. A possible side reaction is derivatization of methionine. In our analysis of derivatized human lens alphaA-crystallins, we found an apparent molecular mass 48 Da lower than the mass expected for alphaA-crystallin with the cysteines carboxyamidomethylated. Analysis of a tryptic digest of this protein showed that both cysteines and one methionine had been derivatized. Peaks indicating a molecular mass 48 Da less than expected for the protein with only cysteines derivatized were attributed to fragmentation of the derivatized methionine through collision-induced dissociation in the electrospray ionization source. An awareness of this artifact is important to investigators searching for proteins and their modified forms in complex mixtures.},

Here, we describe the molecular architecture of the 26S holocomplex determined by an integrative approach based on data from cryoelectron microscopy, X-ray crystallography, residue-specific chemical cross-linking, and several proteomics techniques. The "lid" of the RP (consisting of Rpn3/5/6/7/8/9/11/12) is organized in a modular fashion. Rpn3/5/6/7/9/12 form a horseshoe-shaped heterohexamer, which connects to the CP and roofs the AAA-ATPase module, positioning the Rpn8/Rpn11 heterodimer close to its mouth. Rpn2 is rigid, supporting the lid, while Rpn1 is conformationally variable, positioned at the periphery of the ATPase ring. The ubiquitin receptors Rpn10 and Rpn13 are located in the distal part of the RP, indicating that they were recruited to the complex late in its evolution. The modular structure of the 26S proteasome provides insights into the sequence of events prior to the degradation of ubiquitylated substrates.},

Glycogen synthase kinase 3$\beta$ (GSK 3$\beta$) is a serine/threonine kinase that is thought to contribute to a variety of biological events, including embryonic development, metabolism, tumorigenesis, and cell death. GSK 3$\beta$ is a constitutively active kinase that regulates many intracellular signaling pathways by phosphorylating substrates such as $\beta$-catenin. We noticed that the putative SUMOylation sites are localized on K292 residueof 291FKFPQ295 in GSK 3$\beta$ based on analysis of the SUMOylation consensus sequence. In this report, we showed that the SUMOylation of GSK 3$\beta$ occurs on its K292 residue, and this modification promotes its nuclear localization in COS-1. Additionally, our data showed that the GSK 3$\beta$ SUMO mutant (K292R) decreased its kinase activity and protein stability, affecting cell death. Therefore, our observations at first time suggested that SUMOylation on the K292 residue of GSK 3$\beta$ might be a GSK 3$\beta$ regulation mechanism for its kinase activation, subcellular localization, protein stability, and cell apoptosis.},

abstract = {Proteomics, the analysis of the protein complement of a cell or an organism, has grown rapidly as a subdiscipline of the life sciences. Mass spectrometry (MS) is one of the central detection techniques in proteome analysis, yet it has to rely on prior sample preparation steps that reduce the enormous complexity of the protein mixtures obtained from biological systems. For that reason, a number of so-called tagging (or labeling) strategies have been developed that target specific amino acid residues or post-translational modifications, enabling the enrichment of subfractions via affinity clean-up, resulting in the identification of an ever increasing number of proteins. In addition, the attachment of stable-isotope-labeled tags now allows the relative quantitation of protein levels of two samples, e.g. those representing different cell states, which is of great significance for drug discovery and molecular biology. Finally, tagging schemes also serve to facilitate interpretation of MS/MS spectra, therefore assisting in de novo elucidation of protein sequences and automated database searching. This review summarizes the different application fields for tagging strategies for today's MS-based proteome analysis. Advantages and drawbacks of the numerous strategies that have appeared in the literature in the last years are highlighted, and an outlook on emerging tagging techniques is given.},

The algorithm utilizes the signals recorded for the different isotopic forms of peptides of identical sequence and numerical and statistical methods, such as Savitzky-Golay smoothing filters, statistics for weighted samples, and Dixon's test for outliers, to evaluate protein abundance ratios and their associated errors. The algorithm also provides a statistical assessment to distinguish proteins of significant abundance changes from a population of proteins of unchanged abundance. To evaluate its performance, two sets of LC-ESI-MS/MS data were analyzed by the ASAPRatio algorithm without human intervention, and the data were related to the expected and manually validated values. The utility of the ASAPRatio program was clearly demonstrated by its speed and the accuracy of the generated protein abundance ratios and by its capability to identify specific core components of the RNA polymerase II transcription complex within a high background of copurifying proteins.},

abstract = {Results are presented showing the ability to obtain C-terminal sequence information from peptides by multiple stages of mass spectrometry. Under typical low-energy collision-induced dissociation conditions of quadrupole ion trap and ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometers, lithium- and sodium-cationized peptides dissociate predominantly by reaction at the C-terminal peptide bond or an adjacent bond. For the majority of cases studied, the dominant reaction is a rearrangement process that results in the loss of the C-terminal residue and formation of a product ion that is one amino acid shorter than the original peptide ion. Using the multistage MS/MS capabilities of quadrupole ion trap and ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometers, a subsequent stage of MS/MS can be performed to determine the identity of the new C-terminal residue. Up to eight stage of MS/MS have been performed with both quadrupole ion trap and ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometers. In general, the same dissociation pathways are observed with both instruments, although occasionally there are significant differences in the branching ratios of competing pathways.},

abstract = {Motivation: Tandem mass spectrometry combined with sequence database searching is one of the most powerful tools for protein identification. As thousands of spectra are generated by a mass spectrometer in one hour, the speed of database searching is critical, especially when searching against a large sequence database, or when the peptide is generated by some unknown or non-specific enzyme, even or when the target peptides have post-translational modifications (PTM). In practice, about 70-90\% of the spectra have no match in the database. Many believe that a significant portion of them are due to peptides of non-specific digestions by unknown enzymes or amino acid modifications. In another case, scientists may choose to use some non-specific enzymes such as pepsin or thermolysin for proteolysis in proteomic study, in that not all proteins are amenable to be digested by some site-specific enzymes, and furthermore many digested peptides may not fall within the rang of molecular weight suitable for mass spectrometry analysis. Interpretating mass spectra of these kinds will cost a lot of computational time of database search engines. Overview: The present study was designed to speed up the database searching process for both cases. More specifically speaking, we employed an approach combining suffix tree data structure and spectrum graph. The suffix tree is used to preprocess the protein sequence database, while the spectrum graph is used to preprocess the tandem mass spectrum. We then search the suffix tree against the spectrum graph for candidate peptides. We design an efficient algorithm to compute a matching threshold with some statistical significance level, e.g. p = 0.01, for each spectrum, and use it to select candidate peptides. Then we rank these peptides using a SEQUEST-like scoring function. The algorithms were implemented and tested on experimental data. For post-translational modifications, we allow arbitrary number of any modification to a protein.

abstract = {A number of different approaches have been described to identify proteins from tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data. The most common approaches rely on the available databases to match experimental MS/MS data. These methods suffer from several drawbacks and cannot be used for the identification of proteins from unknown genomes. In this communication, we describe a new de novo sequencing software package, PEAKS, to extract amino acid sequence information without the use of databases. PEAKS uses a new model and a new algorithm to efficiently compute the best peptide sequences whose fragment ions can best interpret the peaks in the MS/MS spectrum. The output of the software gives amino acid sequences with confidence scores for the entire sequences, as well as an additional novel positional scoring scheme for portions of the sequences. The performance of PEAKS is compared with Lutefisk, a well-known de novo sequencing software, using quadrupole-time-of-flight (Q-TOF) data obtained for several tryptic peptides from standard proteins.},

abstract = {Large-scale genomics has enabled proteomics by creating sequence infrastructures that can be used with mass spectrometry data to identify proteins. Although protein sequences can be deduced from nucleotide sequences, posttranslational modifications to proteins, in general, cannot. We describe a process for the analysis of posttranslational modifications that is simple, robust, general, and can be applied to complicated protein mixtures. A protein or protein mixture is digested by using three different enzymes: one that cleaves in a site-specific manner and two others that cleave nonspecifically. The mixture of peptides is separated by multidimensional liquid chromatography and analyzed by a tandem mass spectrometer. This approach has been applied to modification analyses of proteins in a simple protein mixture, Cdc2p protein complexes isolated through the use of an affinity tag, and lens tissue from a patient with congenital cataracts. Phosphorylation sites have been detected with known stoichiometry of as low as 10\%. Eighteen sites of four different types of modification have been detected on three of the five proteins in a simple mixture, three of which were previously unreported. Three proteins from Cdc2p isolated complexes yielded eight sites containing three different types of modifications. In the lens tissue, 270 proteins were identified, and 11 different crystallins were found to contain a total of 73 sites of modification. Modifications identified in the crystallin proteins included Ser, Thr, and Tyr phosphorylation, Arg and Lys methylation, Lys acetylation, and Met, Tyr, and Trp oxidations. The method presented will be useful in discovering co- and posttranslational modifications of proteins.},

SEQUEST is one of the most common software algorithms used for the analysis of peptide tandem mass spectra by using a cross-correlation (XCorr) scoring routine to match tandem mass spectra to model spectra derived from peptide sequences. To assess a match, SEQUEST uses the difference between the first- and second-ranked sequences (ACn). This value is dependent on the database size, search parameters, and sequence homologies. In this report, we demonstrate the use of a scoring routine (SEQUEST-NORM) that normalizes XCorr values to be independent of peptide size and the database used to perform the search. This new scoring routine is used to objectively calculate the percent confidence of protein identifications and posttranslational modifications based solely on the XCorr value.},

The effect of the different fragmentation mechanisms on the formation of specific fragment ion types and the usability of the resulting spectra, e.g. for high-throughput protein identification, has been evaluated. Also, basic investigations on the influence of the matrix, as well as laser fluence, on the fragment ion formation and the consequences in the spectral appearance are discussed. The preconditions for obtaining 'pure' CID spectra on matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization tandem time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF/TOF) instruments are evaluated and discussed as well as the differences between LID and CID in the resulting fragment ion types. While containing a wealth of information due to additional fragment ions in comparison with LID, CID spectra are significantly more complex than LID spectra and, due to different fragmentation patterns, the CID spectra are of limited use for protein identification, even under optimized parameter settings, due to significantly lower scores for the individual spectra. Conditions for optimal results regarding protein identification using MALDI-TOF/TOF instruments have been evaluated. For database searches using tandem mass spectrometric data, the use of LID as fragmentation technique in combination with parameter settings supporting the use of internal fragment ions turned out to yield the optimal results.},

abstract = {We describe two novel sequence similarity search algorithms, FASTS and FASTF, that use multiple short peptide sequences to identify homologous sequences in protein or DNA databases. FASTS searches with peptide sequences of unknown order, as obtained by mass spectrometry-based sequencing, evaluating all possible arrangements of the peptides. FASTF searches with mixed peptide sequences, as generated by Edman sequencing of unseparated mixtures of peptides. FASTF deconvolutes the mixture, using a greedy heuristic that allows rapid identification of high scoring alignments while reducing the total number of explored alternatives. Both algorithms use the heuristic FASTA comparison strategy to accelerate the search but use alignment probability, rather than similarity score, as the criterion for alignment optimality. Statistical estimates are calculated using an empirical correction to a theoretical probability. These calculated estimates were accurate within a factor of 10 for FASTS and 1000 for FASTF on our test dataset. FASTS requires only 15-20 total residues in three or four peptides to robustly identify homologues sharing 50\% or greater protein sequence identity. FASTF requires about 25\% more sequence data than FASTS for equivalent sensitivity, but additional sequence data are usually available from mixed Edman experiments. Thus, both algorithms can identify homologues that diverged 100 to 500 million years ago, allowing proteomic identification from organisms whose genomes have not been sequenced.},

abstract = {The high success of the "uncertified" mass spectrometry spectral collection started in 1956 demonstrated qualitatively that a partial reference mass spectrum, even one measured routinely, can be of real value. Correct matchings were still possible despite reference errors, which almost never led to close matches that were incorrect. This study shows quantitatively that the number of different compounds, not the number of peaks in a spectrum, is by far the most important determinant of database efficiency for identifying a "global" unknown. A statistical evaluation of matching performance shows that only 6, 12, and 18 peaks in a reference spectrum are 13\%, 67\%, and 96\%, respectively, as valuable as hundreds of peaks. Also, a separately measured second spectrum of the same compound is 50\% as valuable as the first. Database expansion that tripled the number of possible wrong answers only reduced the proportion of correct identifications by 5\%. Corrections of a mass or abundance error in each of six reference spectra increase the database matching performance by as much as the addition of one spectrum of a new compound. A new "matching quality index" based statistically on these values indicates that the largest database is also by far the most effective for matching unknowns.},

Unlike the postsource decay technique that is widely used with MALDI-TOF instruments and typically combines as many as 10 separate spectra of different mass regions, this instrument allows complete fragment ion spectra to be obtained in a single acquisition at a fixed reflectron voltage. To achieve optimum resolution and focusing over the whole mass range, it may be desirable to acquire and combine three separate sections. Different combinations of MALDI matrix and collision gas determine the amount of internal energy deposited by the MALDI process and the CID process, which provide control over the extent and nature of the fragment ions observed.

abstract = {For interrogation of peptides with diverse modifications, no other instrument is as versatile as the Fourier-transform mass spectrometer (FTMS). Particularly using electrospray ionization (ESI), many intact proteins and their proteolytic products harboring post-translational and chemical modifications (PTMs) have been studied by high resolution tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). The widely touted analytical figures of merit for FTMS in fact have translated into clarity when analyzing PTMs from phosphorylations to disulfides, oxidations, methylations, acetylations, and even exotic PTMs found in the biosynthesis of antibiotics and other natural products. A top down approach to PTM detection and localization is proving extensible to an increasing variety of PTMs, some of which are stable to MS/MS at the protein level but unstable to amide bond cleavage by threshold dissociations at the level of small peptides <3 kDa. In contrast, MS/MS using electron capture dissociation (ECD) allows precise localization of even labile PTMs given enough sample and abundant molecular ions. Finally, this brief synopsis of recent literature highlights specific PTMs that perturb the protein backbone therefore altering MS/MS fragmentation patterns. Thus, FTMS will continue its expansion into more laboratories in part because of its ability to detect and deconvolute the regulatory mechanisms of biology written in the language of PTMs.},

abstract = {Formaldehyde is a well known cross-linking agent that can inactivate, stabilize, or immobilize proteins. The purpose of this study was to map the chemical modifications occurring on each natural amino acid residue caused by formaldehyde. Therefore, model peptides were treated with excess formaldehyde, and the reaction products were analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Formaldehyde was shown to react with the amino group of the N-terminal amino acid residue and the side-chains of arginine, cysteine, histidine, and lysine residues. Depending on the peptide sequence, methylol groups, Schiff-bases, and methylene bridges were formed. To study intermolecular cross-linking in more detail, cyanoborohydride or glycine was added to the reaction solution. The use of cyanoborohydride could easily distinguish between peptides containing a Schiff-base or a methylene bridge. Formaldehyde and glycine formed a Schiff-base adduct, which was rapidly attached to primary N-terminal amino groups, arginine and tyrosine residues, and, to a lesser degree, asparagine, glutamine, histidine, and tryptophan residues. Unexpected modifications were found in peptides containing a free N-terminal amino group or an arginine residue. Formaldehyde-glycine adducts reacted with the N terminus by means of two steps: the N terminus formed an imidazolidinone, and then the glycine was attached via a methylene bridge. Two covalent modifications occurred on an arginine-containing peptide: (i) the attachment of one glycine molecule to the arginine residue via two methylene bridges, and (ii) the coupling of two glycine molecules via four methylene bridges. Remarkably, formaldehyde did not generate intermolecular cross-links between two primary amino groups. In conclusion, the use of model peptides enabled us to determine the reactivity of each particular cross-link reaction as a function of the reaction conditions and to identify new reaction products after incubation with formaldehyde.},

To study the mechanism and structure of the complex, we wanted to recombinantly express IKK in a model organism that lacks IKK. For this purpose, we have recombinantly reconstituted all three subunits together in yeast and have found that it is biochemically similar to IKK isolated from human cells. We show that there is one regulatory subunit per kinase subunit. Thus, the core subunit composition of IKKalpha.beta.gamma complex is alpha(1)beta(1)gamma(2), and the core subunit composition of IKKbeta.gamma is beta(2)gamma(2). The activity of the IKK complex (alpha+beta+gamma or beta+gamma) expressed in yeast (which lack NF-kappaB and IKK) is 4-5-fold higher than an equivalent amount of IKK from nonstimulated HeLa cells. In the absence of IKKgamma, IKKbeta shows a level of activity similar to that of IKK from nonstimulated HeLa cells. Thus, IKKgamma activates IKK complex in the absence of upstream stimuli. Deleting the gamma binding domain of IKKbeta or IKKalpha prevented IKKgamma induced activation of IKK complex in yeast, but it did not prevent the incorporation of IKKgamma into IKK and large complex formation. The possibility of IKK complex being under negative control in mammalian cells is discussed.},

The two primary ways of analyzing MS/MS data are database search and de novo sequencing.

(1) It works on data generated from both LCQ and LTQ mass spectrometers and interprets singly, doubly, and triply charged ions. (2) It integrates a new probabilistic scoring function with a mass array-based dynamic programming algorithm. The simplicity of the scoring function, with only 6-10 parameters to be trained, avoids the problem of overfitting and allows MSNovo to be adopted for other machines and data sets easily. The mass array data structure explicitly encodes all possible peptides and allows the dynamic programming algorithm to find the best peptide. (3) Compared to existing programs, MSNovo predicts peptides as well as sequence tags with a higher accuracy, which is important for those applications that search protein databases using the de novo sequencing results. More specifically, we show that MSNovo outperforms other programs on various ESI ion trap data. We also show that for high-resolution data the performance of MSNovo improves significantly.

Peptides that correspond to more than a single protein in the sequence database are apportioned among all corresponding proteins, and a minimal protein list sufficient to account for the observed peptide assignments is derived using the expectation-maximization algorithm. Using peptide assignments to spectra generated from a sample of 18 purified proteins, as well as complex H. influenzae and Halobacterium samples, the model is shown to produce probabilities that are accurate and have high power to discriminate correct from incorrect protein identifications. This method allows filtering of large-scale proteomics data sets with predictable sensitivity and false positive identification error rates. Fast, consistent, and transparent, it provides a standard for publishing large-scale protein identification data sets in the literature and for comparing the results obtained from different experiments.},

abstract = {Many important cell mechanisms are carried out and regulated by multi-protein complexes, for example, transcription and RNA processing machinery, receptor complexes and cytoskeletal structures. Most of these complexes remain only partially characterized due to the difficulty of conventional protein analysis methods. The rapid expansion of DNA sequence databases now provides whole or partial gene sequences of model organisms, and recent advances in protein microcharacterization via mass spectrometry allow the possibility of linking these DNA sequences to the proteins in functional complexes. This approach has been demonstrated in organisms whose genomes have been sequenced, such as budding yeast. Here we report the first characterization of an entire mammalian multi-protein complex using these methods. The machinery that removes introns from mRNA precursors--the spliceosome--is a large multi-protein complex. Approximately half of the components excised from a two-dimensional gel separation of the spliceosome were found in protein sequence databases. Using nanoelectrospray mass spectrometry, the remainder were identified and cloned using public expressed sequence tag (EST) databases. Existing EST databases are thus already sufficiently complete to allow rapid characterization of large mammalian protein complexes via mass spectrometry.},

Even in favorable cases, routine liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry detects from protein digests peptides covering 50-90\% of the sequence. Here we investigated the reasons for limited peptide detection, considering various physicochemical aspects of peptide behavior in liquid chromatography-Fourier transform mass spectrometry (LC-FTMS). No overall correlation was found between the detection probability and peptide mass. In agreement with literature data, the signal increased with peptide hydrophobicity. Surprisingly, the pI values exhibited an opposite trend, with more acidic tryptic peptides detected with higher probability. A mixture of synthesized peptides of similar masses confirmed the hydrophobicity dependence but showed strong positive correlation between pI and signal response. An explanation of this paradoxal behavior was found through the observation that more acidic tryptic peptide lengths tend to be longer. Longer peptides tend to acquire higher average charge state in positive mode electrospray ionization than more basic but shorter counterparts. The induced-current detection in FTMS favors ions in higher charge states, thus providing the observed pI-FTMS signal anticorrelation.},

abstract = {Identification of proteins by MS/MS is performed by matching experimental mass spectra against calculated spectra of all possible peptides in a protein data base. The search engine assigns each spectrum a score indicating how well the experimental data complies with the expected one; a higher score means increased confidence in the identification. One problem is the false-positive identifications, which arise from incomplete data as well as from the presence of misleading ions in experimental mass spectra due to gas-phase reactions, stray ions, contaminants, and electronic noise. We employed a novel technique of reduction of false positives that is based on a combined use of orthogonal fragmentation techniques electron capture dissociation (ECD) and collisionally activated dissociation (CAD). Since ECD and CAD exhibit many complementary properties, their combined use greatly increased the analysis specificity, which was further strengthened by the high mass accuracy (approximately 1 ppm) afforded by Fourier transform mass spectrometry. The utility of this approach is demonstrated on a whole cell lysate from Escherichia coli. Analysis was made using the data-dependent acquisition mode. Extraction of complementary sequence information was performed prior to data base search using in-house written software. Only masses involved in complementary pairs in the MS/MS spectrum from the same or orthogonal fragmentation techniques were submitted to the data base search. ECD/CAD identified twice as many proteins at a fixed statistically significant confidence level with on average a 64\% higher Mascot score. The confidence in protein identification was hereby increased by more than 1 order of magnitude. The combined ECD/CAD searches were on average 20\% faster than CAD-only searches. A specially developed test with scrambled MS/MS data revealed that the amount of false-positive identifications was dramatically reduced by the combined use of CAD and ECD.},

abstract = {The complexity of the human proteome, already enormous at the organism level, increases further in the course of the proteome analysis due to in vitro sample evolution. Most of in vitro alterations can also occur in vivo as post-translational modifications. These two types of modifications can only be distinguished a posteriori but not in the process of analysis, thus rendering necessary the analysis of every molecule in the sample. With the new software tool ModifiComb applied to MS/MS data, the extent of modifications was measured in tryptic mixtures representing the full proteome of human cells. The estimated level of 8-12 modified peptides per each unmodified tryptic peptide present at >or=1\% level is approaching one modification per amino acid on average. This is a higher modification rate than was previously thought, posing an additional challenge to analytical techniques. The solution to the problem is seen in improving sample preparation routines, introducing dynamic range-adjusted thresholds for database searches, using more specific MS/MS analysis using high mass accuracy and complementary fragmentation techniques, and revealing peptide families with identification of additional proteins only by unfamiliar peptides. Extensive protein separation prior to analysis reduces the requirements on speed and dynamic range of a tandem mass spectrometer and can be a viable alternative to the shotgun approach.},

abstract = {MS-based proteomics usually involves the fragmentation of tryptic peptides (tandem MS or MS(2)) and their identification by searching protein sequence databases. In ion trap instruments fragments can be further fragmented and analyzed, a process termed MS/MS/MS or MS(3). Here, we report that efficient ion capture in a linear ion trap leads to MS(3) acquisition times and spectra quality similar to those for MS(2) experiments with conventional 3D ion traps. Fragmentation of N- or C-terminal ions resulted in informative and low-background spectra, even at subfemtomol levels of peptide. Typically C-terminal ions are chosen for further fragmentation, and the MS(3) spectrum greatly constrains the C-terminal amino acids of the peptide sequence. MS(3) spectra allow resolution of ambiguities in identification, a crucial problem in proteomics. Because of the sensitivity and rapid scan rates of the linear ion trap, several MS(3) spectra per peptide can be obtained even when sequencing very complex mixtures. We calculate the probability that an experimental MS(3) spectrum originates from fragmentation of a given N- or C-terminal ion of a peptide under consideration. This MS(3) identification score can be combined with the MS(2) scores of the precursor peptide from existing search engines. When MS(3) is performed on the linear ion trap-Fourier transform mass spectrometer combination, accurate peptide masses further increase confidence in peptide identification.},

abstract = {Quantitative proteomics has traditionally been performed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, but recently, mass spectrometric methods based on stable isotope quantitation have shown great promise for the simultaneous and automated identification and quantitation of complex protein mixtures. Here we describe a method, termed SILAC, for stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture, for the in vivo incorporation of specific amino acids into all mammalian proteins. Mammalian cell lines are grown in media lacking a standard essential amino acid but supplemented with a non-radioactive, isotopically labeled form of that amino acid, in this case deuterated leucine (Leu-d3). We find that growth of cells maintained in these media is no different from growth in normal media as evidenced by cell morphology, doubling time, and ability to differentiate. Complete incorporation of Leu-d3 occurred after five doublings in the cell lines and proteins studied. Protein populations from experimental and control samples are mixed directly after harvesting, and mass spectrometric identification is straightforward as every leucine-containing peptide incorporates either all normal leucine or all Leu-d3. We have applied this technique to the relative quantitation of changes in protein expression during the process of muscle cell differentiation. Proteins that were found to be up-regulated during this process include glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, fibronectin, and pyruvate kinase M2. SILAC is a simple, inexpensive, and accurate procedure that can be used as a quantitative proteomic approach in any cell culture system.},

abstract = {Two methods have been developed for protein identification from tandem mass spectra: database searching and de novo sequencing. De novo sequencing identifies peptide directly from tandem mass spectra. Among many proposed algorithms, we evaluated the performance of the five de novo sequencing algorithms, AUDENS, Lutefisk, NovoHMM, PepNovo, and PEAKS. Our evaluation methods are based on calculation of relative sequence distance (RSD), algorithm sensitivity, and spectrum quality. We found that de novo sequencing algorithms have different performance in analyzing QSTAR and LCQ mass spectrometer data, but in general, perform better in analyzing QSTAR data than LCQ data. For the QSTAR data, the performance order of the five algorithms is PEAKS > Lutefisk, PepNovo > AUDENS, NovoHMM. The performance of PEAKS, Lutefisk, and PepNovo strongly depends on the spectrum quality and increases with an increase of spectrum quality. However, AUDENS and NovoHMM are not sensitive to the spectrum quality. Compared with other four algorithms, PEAKS has the best sensitivity and also has the best performance in the entire range of spectrum quality. For the LCQ data, the performance order is NovoHMM > PepNovo, PEAKS > Lutefisk > AUDENS. NovoHMM has the best sensitivity, and its performance is the best in the entire range of spectrum quality. But the overall performance of NovoHMM is not significantly different from the performance of PEAKS and PepNovo. AUDENS does not give a good performance in analyzing either QSTAR and LCQ data.},

A method that cross-correlates and clusters related spectra in large collections of uncharacterized spectra (i.e., from normal and diseased individuals) would be very valuable in functional proteomics. This problem is far from being simple since very similar peptides may have very different spectra. We introduce a new notion of spectral similarity that allows one to identify related spectra even if the corresponding peptides have multiple modifications/mutations.

abstract = {Although protein identification by matching tandem mass spectra (MS/MS) against protein databases is a widespread tool in mass spectrometry, the question about reliability of such searches remains open. Absence of rigorous significance scores in MS/MS database search makes it difficult to discard random database hits and may lead to erroneous protein identification, particularly in the case of mutated or post-translationally modified peptides. This problem is especially important for high-throughput MS/MS projects when the possibility of expert analysis is limited. Thus, algorithms that sort out reliable database hits from unreliable ones and identify mutated and modified peptides are sought. Most MS/MS database search algorithms rely on variations of the Shared Peaks Count approach that scores pairs of spectra by the peaks (masses) they have in common. Although this approach proved to be useful, it has a high error rate in identification of mutated and modified peptides. We describe new MS/MS database search tools, MS-CONVOLUTION and MS-ALIGNMENT, which implement the spectral convolution and spectral alignment approaches to peptide identification. We further analyze these approaches to identification of modified peptides and demonstrate their advantages over the Shared Peaks Count. We also use the spectral alignment approach as a filter in a new database search algorithm that reliably identifies peptides differing by up to two mutations/modifications from a peptide in a database.},

A., Schutz, F., Reid, G. E., Eddes, J. S., Moritz, R. L., O'Hair, R. A. J., Speed, T. P. and Simpson, R. J. Anal. Chem. 2003, 75, 6251-6264.]. Here, we have reexamined this database in order to determine the effect of a common post-translational or process induced modification, methionine oxidation, on the appearance and relative abundances of the product ions formed by low energy collision induced dissociation of peptide ions containing this modification. The results from this study indicate that the structurally diagnostic neutral loss of methane sulfenic acid (CH3SOH, 64Da) from the side chain of methionine sulfoxide residues is the dominant fragmentation process for methionine sulfoxide containing peptide ions under conditions of low proton mobility, i.e., when ionizing proton(s) are sequestered at strongly basic amino acids such as arginine, lysine or histidine. The product ion abundances resulting from this neutral loss were found to be approximately 2-fold greater than those resulting from the cleavage C-terminal to aspartic acid, which has previously been shown to be enhanced under the same conditions. In close agreement with these statistical trends, experimental and theoretical studies, employing synthetic "tryptic" peptides and model methionine sulfoxide containing peptide ions, have determined that the mechanism for enhanced methionine sulfoxide side chain cleavage proceeds primarily via a 'charge remote' process. However, the mechanism for dissociation of the side chain for these ions was observed to change as a function of proton mobility. Finally, the transition state barrier for the charge remote side chain cleavage mechanism is predicted to be energetically more favorable than that for charge remote cleavage C-terminal to aspartic acid.},

We describe a parallel version of SEQUEST (SEQUEST-PVM) that is tolerant toward arithmetic exceptions. The changes we report effectively separate search processes on slave nodes from each other. Therefore, if one of the slave nodes drops out of the cluster due to an error, the rest of the cluster will carry the search process to the end. SEQUEST has been widely used for protein identifications. The modifications made to the code improve its stability and effectiveness in a high-throughput production environment. We evaluate the overhead associated with the parallelization of SEQUEST. A prior version of software to preprocess LC/MS/MS data attempted to differentiate the charge states of ions. Singly charged ions can be accurately identified, but the software was unable to reliably differentiate tandem mass spectra of +2 and +3 charge states. We have designed and implemented a computational approach to narrow charge states of precursor ions from nominal resolution ion-trap tandem mass spectra. The preprocessing code, 2to3, determines the charge state of the precursor ion using its mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) and fragment ions contained in the tandem mass spectrum. For each possible charge state the program calculates the expected fragment ions that account for precursor ion m/z values. If any one of the numbers is less than an empirically determined threshold value then the spectrum corresponding to that charge state is removed. If both numbers are higher than the threshold value then +2 and +3 copies of the spectrum are kept. We present the comparison of results from protein identification experiments with and without using 2 to 3. It is shown that by determining the charge state and eliminating poor quality spectra 2to3 decreases the number of spectral files to be searched without affecting the search results. The decrease reduces computer requirements and researcher efforts for analysis of the results.},

abstract = {We present a new probability-based method for protein identification using tandem mass spectra and protein databases. The method employs a hypergeometric distribution to model frequencies of matches between fragment ions predicted for peptide sequences with a specific (M + H)+ value (at some mass tolerance) in a protein sequence database and an experimental tandem mass spectrum. The hypergeometric distribution constitutes null hypothesis-all peptide matches to a tandem mass spectrum are random. It is used to generate a score characterizing the randomness of a database sequence match to an experimental tandem mass spectrum and to determine the level of significance of the null hypothesis. For each tandem mass spectrum and database search, a peptide is identified that has the least probability of being a random match to the spectrum and the corresponding level of significance of the null hypothesis is determined. To check the validity of the hypergeometric model in describing fragment ion matches, we used chi2 test. The distribution of frequencies and corresponding hypergeometric probabilities are generated for each tandem mass spectrum. No proteolytic cleavage specificity is used to create the peptide sequences from the database. We do not use any empirical probabilities in this method. The scores generated by the hypergeometric model do not have a significant molecular weight bias and are reasonably independent of database size. The approach has been implemented in a database search algorithm, PEP\_PROBE. By using a large set of tandem mass spectra derived from a set of peptides created by digestion of a collection of known proteins using four different proteases, a false positive rate of 5\% is demonstrated.},

abstract = {The conventional approach in modern proteomics to identify proteins from limited information provided by molecular and fragment masses of their enzymatic degradation products carries an inherent risk of both false positive and false negative identifications. For reliable identification of even known proteins, complete de novo sequencing of their peptides is desired. The main problems of conventional sequencing based on tandem mass spectrometry are incomplete backbone fragmentation and the frequent overlap of fragment masses. In this work, the first proteomics-grade de novo approach is presented, where the above problems are alleviated by the use of complementary fragmentation techniques CAD and ECD. Implementation of a high-current, large-area dispenser cathode as a source of low-energy electrons provided efficient ECD of doubly charged peptides, the most abundant species (65-80\%), in a typical trypsin-based proteomics experiment. A new linear de novo algorithm is developed combining efficiency and speed, processing on a conventional 3 GHz PC, 1000 MS/MS data sets in 60 s. More than 6\% of all MS/MS data for doubly charged peptides yielded complete sequences, and another 13\% gave nearly complete sequences with a maximum gap of two amino acid residues. These figures are comparable with the typical success rates (5-15\%) of database identification. For peptides reliably found in the database (Mowse score > or = 34), the agreement with de novo-derived full sequences was >95\%. Full sequences were derived in 67\% of the cases when full sequence information was present in MS/MS spectra. Thus the new de novo sequencing approach reached the same level of efficiency and reliability as conventional database-identification strategies.},

abstract = {The Mascot score (M-score) is one of the conventional validity measures in data base identification of peptides and proteins by MS/MS data. Although tremendously useful, M-score has a number of limitations. For the same MS/MS data, M-score may change if the protein data base is expanded. A low M-value may not necessarily mean poor match but rather poor MS/MS quality. In addition M-score does not fully utilize the advantage of combined use of complementary fragmentation techniques collisionally activated dissociation (CAD) and electron capture dissociation (ECD). To address these issues, a new data base-independent scoring method (S-score) was designed that is based on the maximum length of the peptide sequence tag provided by the combined CAD and ECD data. The quality of MS/MS spectra assessed by S-score allows poor data (39\% of all MS/MS spectra) to be filtered out before the data base search, speeding up the data analysis and eliminating a major source of false positive identifications. Spectra with below threshold M-scores (poor matches) but high S-scores are validated. Spectra with zero M-score (no data base match) but high S-score are classified as belonging to modified sequences. As an extension of S-score, an extremely reliable sequence tag was developed based on complementary fragments simultaneously appearing in CAD and ECD spectra. Comparison of this tag with the data base-derived sequence gives the most reliable peptide identification validation to date. The combined use of M- and S-scoring provides positive sequence identification from >25\% of all MS/MS data, a 40\% improvement over traditional M-scoring performed on the same Fourier transform MS instrumentation. The number of proteins reliably identified from Escherichia coli cell lysate hereby increased by 29\% compared with the traditional M-score approach. Finally S-scoring provides a quantitative measure of the quality of fragmentation techniques such as the minimum abundance of the precursor ion, the MS/MS of which gives the threshold S-score value of 2.},

abstract = {A major challenge in proteomics is to fully identify and characterize the post-translational modification (PTM) patterns present at any given time in cells, tissues, and organisms. Here we present a fast and reliable method ("ModifiComb") for mapping hundreds types of PTMs at a time, including novel and unexpected PTMs. The high mass accuracy of Fourier transform mass spectrometry provides in many cases unique elemental composition of the PTM through the difference DeltaM between the molecular masses of the modified and unmodified peptides, whereas the retention time difference DeltaRT between their elution in reversed-phase liquid chromatography provides an additional dimension for PTM identification. Abundant sequence information obtained with complementary fragmentation techniques using ion-neutral collisions and electron capture often locates the modification to a single residue. The (DeltaM, DeltaRT) maps are representative of the proteome and its overall modification state and may be used for database-independent organism identification, comparative proteomic studies, and biomarker discovery. Examples of newly found modifications include +12.000 Da (+C atom) incorporation into proline residues of peptides from proline-rich proteins found in human saliva. This modification is hypothesized to increase the known activity of the peptide.},

abstract = {The gas-phase fragmentation reactions of a series of site-directed mutagenesis products of Staphylococcus aureus dihydroneopterin aldolase have been examined by multistage tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS and MS(3)) in a linear quadrupole ion trap in order to explore the utility of this instrumentation for routine 'top-down' recombinant protein characterization. Following a rapid low resolution survey of the fragmentation behavior of the precursor ions from the wild type (WT) protein, selected charge states were subjected to detailed structural characterization by using high resolution 'zoom' and 'ultrazoom' resonance ejection MS/MS product ion scans. Dissociation of the [M + 18H](18+) charge state yielded a range of product ions from which extensive sequence information could be derived. In contrast, dissociation of the [M + 20H](20+) charge state resulted in a single dominant y(96) product ion formed by fragmentation between adjacent Ile/Gly residues, with only limited sequence coverage. Further extensive sequence information was readily obtained however, by MS(3) dissociation of this initial product. From the combined MS/MS and MS(3) spectra an overall sequence coverage of 66.9\%, with fragmentation of 85 of the 127 amide bonds within the WT protein, was obtained. MS/MS and MS(3) of three of the four site-directed mutagenesis products (E29A), (Y61F) and (E81A) were found to yield essentially identical product ion spectra to the WT protein, indicating that these modifications had no significant influence on the fragmentation behavior. The specific site of modification could be unambiguously determined in each case by characterization of product ions resulting from fragmentation of amide bonds on either side of the mutation site. In contrast, MS/MS and MS(3) of the K107A mutant led to significantly different product ion spectra dominated by cleavages occurring N-terminal to proline, which restricted the ability to localize the modification site to within only an 8 amino acid region of the sequence. This work highlights the need for further studies to characterize the charge state, sequence and structural dependence to the low energy collision induced dissociation reactions of multiply protonated intact protein ions.},

Using this mass list, the majority of low mass ions in quadrupole-time of flight tandem mass spectra of peptides from tryptic digests and from an elastase digest could be assigned. Besides the a(2)/b(2) ions, which carry residues 1-2 from the N-terminus, a variety of internal dipeptide b ions were regularly observed. In case internal proline was present, corresponding dipeptide b ions carrying proline at the N-terminal position occurred. By assigning the dipeptide b ions on the basis of their accurate mass, bidirectional or unidirectional sequence information was obtained, which is localized to the peptide N-terminus (a(2)/b(2) ions) or not localized (internal b ions). Identification of the y(1) and y(2) ions by their accurate mass provides unidirectional sequence information localized to the peptide C-terminus. It is shown that this patchwork-type sequence information extractable from accurate mass data of low-mass ions is highly efficient for protein identification.},

However, during the transition from qualitative to quantitative protein analysis, the potential and challenges will be tightly coupled. Several strategies for differential proteomics that involve stable isotopes or label-free comparisons and their statistical assessment are possible, each having specific strengths and limitations. Furthermore, incomplete proteome coverage and restricted dynamic range still impose the strongest limitations to data throughput and precise quantitative analysis.

abstract = {With the increasing availability of de novo sequencing algorithms for interpreting high-mass accuracy tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data, there is a growing need for programs that accurately identify proteins from de novo sequencing results. De novo sequences derived from tandem mass spectra of peptides often contain ambiguous regions where the exact amino acid order cannot be determined. One problem this poses for sequence alignment algorithms is the difficulty in distinguishing discrepancies due to de novo sequencing errors from actual genomic sequence variation and posttranslational modifications. We present a novel, mass-based approach to sequence alignment, implemented as a program called OpenSea, to resolve these problems. In this approach, de novo and database sequences are interpreted as masses of residues, and the masses, rather than the amino acid codes, are compared. To provide further flexibility, the masses can be aligned in groups, which can resolve many de novo sequencing errors. The performance of OpenSea was tested with three types of data: a mixture of known proteins, a mixture of unknown proteins that commonly contain sequence variations, and a mixture of posttranslationally modified known proteins. In all three cases, we demonstrate that OpenSea can identify more peptides and proteins than commonly used database-searching programs (SEQUEST and ProteinLynx) while accurately locating sequence variation sites and unanticipated posttranslational modifications in a high-throughput environment.},

abstract = {Protein microanalysis usually involves the sequencing of gel-separated proteins available in very small amounts. While mass spectrometry has become the method of choice for identifying proteins in databases, in almost all laboratories 'de novo' protein sequencing is still performed by Edman degradation. Here we show that a combination of the nanoelectrospray ion source, isotopic end labeling of peptides and a quadrupole/ time-of-flight instrument allows facile read-out of the sequences of tryptic peptides. Isotopic labeling was performed by enzymatic digestion of proteins in 1:1 16O/18O water, eliminating the need for peptide derivatization. A quadrupole/time-of-flight mass spectrometer was constructed from a triple quadrupole and an electrospray time-of-flight instrument. Tandem mass spectra of peptides were obtained with better than 50 ppm mass accuracy and resolution routinely in excess of 5000. Unique and error tolerant identification of yeast proteins as well as the sequencing of a novel protein illustrate the potential of the approach. The high data quality in tandem mass spectra and the additional information provided by the isotopic end labeling of peptides enabled automated interpretation of the spectra via simple software algorithms. The technique demonstrated here removes one of the last obstacles to routine and high throughput protein sequencing by mass spectrometry.},

The following features are incorporated in the algorithm. The members of the set of sequence ions are represented by all possible combinations of N- and C-terminal fragment ions. From the known N- and C-terminating groups and molecular weight (MW) of the peptide, the sequence ions are mathematically re-expressed as N-terminal residue ions and arranged in ascending order. The peptide sequence is computed, in a stepwise iterative procedure, from the mass differences between the mathematically re-expressed N-terminal residue ions and the predicted peptide subsequences for the neighboring ions of lower mass. These mass differences correspond to combinations of known amino acid residues which have previously been computed and tabulated, based upon the FAB fragmentation rules for peptides. The algorithm was successfully applied to sequence the following peptides from their respective FAB or FAB tandem mass spectrum: decapeptyl (MW 1310), angiotensin II (MW 1045), and two 'unknown' peptides (MW 1227 and 1485, respectively). Two criteria used to predict the correct peptide sequence from among many possibilities are the minimum number of amino acid residues and the maximum fragmentation probability per amino acid residue.},

The MultiTag method presented here assigns statistical significance to matches of multiple error-tolerant sequence tags to a database entry and ranks alignments by their significance. The MultiTag approach has the distinct advantage over other sequence-similarity approaches of being able to perform sequence-similarity identifications using only very short (2-4) amino acid residue stretches of peptide sequences, rather than complete peptide sequences deduced by de novo interpretation of tandem mass spectra.

Due to its small size, formaldehyde can readily permeate cell walls and membranes, resulting in efficient cross-linking, i.e. the formation of covalent bonds between proteins, DNA, and other reactive molecules. Indeed, formaldehyde cross-linking is an instrumental component of many mainstream analytical/cell biology techniques including chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of protein-DNA complexes found in nuclei; immunohistological analysis of protein expression and localization within cells, tissues, and organs; and mass spectrometry (MS)-compatible silver-staining methodologies used to visualize low abundance proteins in polyacrylamide gels. However, despite its exquisite suitability for use in the analysis of protein environments within cells, formaldehyde has yet to be commonly employed in the directed analysis of protein-protein interactions and cellular networks. The general purpose of this article is to discuss recent advancements in the use of formaldehyde cross-linking in combination with MS-based methodologies. Key advantages and limitations to the use of formaldehyde over other cross-linkers and technologies currently used to study protein-protein interactions are highlighted, and formaldehyde-based experimental approaches that are proving very promising in their ability to accurately and efficiently identify novel protein-protein and multiprotein interaction complexes are presented.},

These UV filter adducts increase in amount with age and appear to be mainly responsible for the yellowing of the lens in man. On the basis of research performed in other tissues, it has been assumed that indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) may be the first and probably rate-limiting enzyme in UV filter biosynthesis. In this study, 25 human lenses were examined by a reliable and sensitive assay method with a monoclonal antibody specific for IDO. IDO activity was detected in all lenses ranging from 26 to 80 years, and there was no clear relationship of IDO activity with age. The mean activity was 0.85 + 0.49 nmol of kynurenine/h/lens. The level in the iris/ciliary body was negligible (<0.05 nmol of kynurenine/h). The lens IDO activity is consistent with UV filter turnover values obtained previously. These findings indicate that IDO is the first enzyme in the UV filter pathway and that UV filter biosynthesis is active even in aged lenses. Yellowing of the aged lens may therefore be preventable by drug-induced suppression of IDO activity.},

abstract = {We present an MS/MS database search algorithm with the following novel features: (1) a novel protein database structure containing extensive preindexing and (2) zone modification searching, which enables the rapid discovery of protein modifications of known (i.e., user-specified) and unanticipated delta masses. All of these features are implemented in Interrogator, the search engine that runs behind the Pro ID, Pro ICAT, and Pro QUANT software products. Speed benchmarks demonstrate that our modification-tolerant database search algorithm is 100-fold faster than traditional database search algorithms when used for comprehensive searches for a broad variety of modification species. The ability to rapidly search for a large variety of known as well as unanticipated modifications allows a significantly greater percentage of MS/MS scans to be identified. We demonstrate this with an example in which, out of a total of 473 identified MS/MS scans, 315 of these scans correspond to unmodified peptides, while 158 scans correspond to a wide variety of modified peptides. In addition, we provide specific examples where the ability to search for unanticipated modifications allows the scientist to discover: unexpected modifications that have biological significance; amino acid mutations; salt-adducted peptides in a sample that has nominally been desalted; peptides arising from nontryptic cleavage in a sample that has nominally been digested using trypsin; other unintended consequences of sample handling procedures.},

In spite of tremendous recent advances in computational gene finding, comprehensive annotation remains a challenge. Peptide mass spectrometry is a powerful tool for researching the dynamic proteome and suggests an attractive approach to discover and validate protein-coding genes. We present algorithms to construct and efficiently search spectra against a genomic database, with no prior knowledge of encoded proteins. By searching a corpus of 18.5 million tandem mass spectra (MS/MS) from human proteomic samples, we validate 39,000 exons and 11,000 introns at the level of translation. We present translation-level evidence for novel or extended exons in 16 genes, confirm translation of 224 hypothetical proteins, and discover or confirm over 40 alternative splicing events. Polymorphisms are efficiently encoded in our database, allowing us to observe variant alleles for 308 coding SNPs. Finally, we demonstrate the use of mass spectrometry to improve automated gene prediction, adding 800 correct exons to our predictions using a simple rescoring strategy. Our results demonstrate that proteomic profiling should play a role in any genome sequencing project.},

We describe a tool, InsPecT, to identify posttranslational modifications using tandem mass spectrometry data. InsPecT constructs database filters that proved to be very successful in genomics searches. Given an MS/MS spectrum S and a database D, a database filter selects a small fraction of database D that is guaranteed (with high probability) to contain a peptide that produced S. InsPecT uses peptide sequence tags as efficient filters that reduce the size of the database by a few orders of magnitude while retaining the correct peptide with very high probability. In addition to filtering, InsPecT also uses novel algorithms for scoring and validating in the presence of modifications, without explicit enumeration of all variants. InsPecT identifies modified peptides with better or equivalent accuracy than other database search tools while being 2 orders of magnitude faster than SEQUEST, and substantially faster than X!TANDEM on complex mixtures. The tool was used to identify a number of novel modifications in different data sets, including many phosphopeptides in data provided by Alliance for Cellular Signaling that were missed by other tools.},

abstract = {A method is described for searching protein sequence databases using tandem mass spectra of tryptic peptides. The approach uses a de novo sequencing algorithm to derive a short list of possible sequence candidates which serve as query sequences in a subsequent homology-based database search routine. The sequencing algorithm employs a graph theory approach similar to previously described sequencing programs. In addition, amino acid composition, peptide sequence tags and incomplete or ambiguous Edman sequence data can be used to aid in the sequence determinations. Although sequencing of peptides from tandem mass spectra is possible, one of the frequently encountered difficulties is that several alternative sequences can be deduced from one spectrum. Most of the alternative sequences, however, are sufficiently similar for a homology-based sequence database search to be possible. Unfortunately, the available protein sequence database search algorithms (e.g. Blast or FASTA) require a single unambiguous sequence as input. Here we describe how the publicly available FASTA computer program was modified in order to search protein databases more effectively in spite of the ambiguities intrinsic in de novo peptide sequencing algorithms.},

abstract = {There are several computer programs that can match peptide tandem mass spectrometry data to their exactly corresponding database sequences, and in most protein identification projects, these programs are utilized in the early stages of data interpretation. However, situations frequently arise where tandem mass spectral data cannot be correlated with any database sequences. In these cases, the unmatched data could be due to peptides derived from novel proteins, allelic or species-derived variants of known proteins, or posttranslational or chemical modifications. Two additional problems are frequently encountered in high-throughput protein identification. First, it is difficult to quickly sift through large amounts of data to identify those spectra that, due to poor signal or contaminants, can be ignored. Second, it is important to find incorrect database matches (false positives). We have chosen to address these difficulties by performing automatic de novo sequencing using a computer program called Lutefisk. Sequence candidates obtained are used as input in a homology-based database search program called CIDentify to identify variants of known proteins. Comparison of database-derived sequences with de novo sequences allows for electronic validation of database matches even if the latter are not completely correct. Modifications to the original Lutefisk program have been implemented to handle data obtained from triple quadrupole, ion trap, and quadrupole/time-of-flight hybrid (Qtof) mass spectrometers. For example, the linearity of mass errors due to temperature-dependent expansion of the flight tube in a Qtof was exploited such that isobaric amino acids (glutamine/lysine and oxidized methionine/ phenylalanine) can be differentiated without careful attention to mass calibration.},

We describe an unrestrictive PTM search algorithm, MS-Alignment, that searches for all types of PTMs at once in a blind mode, that is, without knowing which PTMs exist in nature. Blind PTM identification makes it possible to study the extent and frequency of different types of PTMs, still an open problem in proteomics. Application of this approach to lens proteins resulted in the largest set of PTMs reported in human crystallins so far. Our analysis of various MS/MS data sets implies that the biological phenomenon of modification is much more widespread than previously thought. We also argue that MS-Alignment reveals some uncharacterized modifications that warrant further experimental validation.},

In one approach, we constructed a protein array of about 6,000 yeast transformants, with each transformant expressing one of the open reading frames as a fusion to an activation domain. This array was screened by a simple and automated procedure for 192 yeast proteins, with positive responses identified by their positions in the array. In a second approach, we pooled cells expressing one of about 6,000 activation domain fusions to generate a library. We used a high-throughput screening procedure to screen nearly all of the 6,000 predicted yeast proteins, expressed as Gal4 DNA-binding domain fusion proteins, against the library, and characterized positives by sequence analysis. These approaches resulted in the detection of 957 putative interactions involving 1,004 S. cerevisiae proteins. These data reveal interactions that place functionally unclassified proteins in a biological context, interactions between proteins involved in the same biological function, and interactions that link biological functions together into larger cellular processes. The results of these screens are shown here.},

At the heart of this technology is the ability to reproducibly acquire high-quality tandem mass spectra for database interrogation. The variability in tandem mass spectra generation is often assumed to be minimal, and peptide identifications are typically based on a single tandem mass spectrum. In this paper, we characterize the variance of scores derived from replicate tandem mass spectra using several database search algorithms and demonstrate the effects of spectral variability on the correct identification of peptides. We show that the variance associated with the collection of tandem mass spectra can be substantial leading to sizable errors in search algorithm scores ( approximately 5-25\% RSD) and ultimately incorrect assignments. Processing strategies are discussed to minimize the impact of tandem mass spectra variability on peptide identification.},

abstract = {Tryptophan deficiency is known for long time to cause cataract in rats. However, up till now the underlying mechanism is still enigmatic. Histological studies showed an extended lens bow suggesting that the normal breakdown of nuclei in the lens fibres is arrested under these conditions. Using advanced ultrastructural techniques we aimed to clarify this aberrant final differentiation of lens fibres. Albino and pigmented rats were permanently or intermittently raised on a tryptophan deficient diet for 12 and 16 weeks, respectively. Rats of the same age raised on a normal diet served as controls. Lenses were treated for light and electron microscopy. For histology sections were stained for DNA and gamma-crystallins. In addition to routine transmission electron microscopy (TEM), ultrathin sections were subjected to electron tomography and energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis (EDX). Histology verified the extended lens bow for albino and pigmented rats and showed that in the intermittent period of normal diet the fibre nuclei are broken down as in controls. It was further shown that gamma-crystallins are co-localized with DNA in the nuclear domain. TEM revealed that during final differentiation nuclear chromatin becomes highly compacted in a chromosome-like manner and than rapidly evanesces in control rats. This compacted stage persists indefinitely in the tryptophan deficient rats. Electron tomography showed that during differentiation chromatin is first uncoiled to 30 nm solenoids, subsequently to highly compacted 10 nm beads-on-a-string fibrils and than is segregated from the nuclear proteins. EDX revealed that the late stage persisting nuclei consist of domains rich in DNA associated with histones and in domains with mainly proteins. This study corroborates previous findings on the final breakdown of nuclei of lens fibres. It further shows that the chromatin is ultimately uncoiled to beads-on-a-string fibrils and that as the last step chromatin is broken down at this unmasked stage. Except for this last step nuclear breakdown is identical in control and tryptophan deficient rats suggesting that it is not the availability of tryptophan for protein synthesis in general which causes the arrest. Two alternatives for this final arrest are discussed. A low tryptophan content, most pronounced in deeper cortical layers, may inhibit the late synthesis of the DNases and proteases necessary for chromatin breakdown. The radical scavenging by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, which cleaves the pyrrole ring of tryptophan to form formylkynurenine using free oxygen radicals, is impaired by low levels of tryptophan. This decreased scavenging of oxygen radicals will expose the catalytic enzymes for chromatin breakdown, residing in the nucleus in an inactive form for quite a long period, to high levels of oxygen radicals and may affect the activity of these enzymes and therefore the execution of the chromatin breakdown.},

Three aged lenses, two of which had moderate cataract, and one young control lens were analyzed using multidimensional liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. In total, 491 modification sites in lens proteins were identified. There were 155 in vivo PTM sites in crystallins: 77 previously reported sites and 78 newly detected PTM sites. Several of these sites had modifications previously undetected by mass spectrometry in lens including carboxymethyl lysine (+58 Da), carboxyethyl lysine (+72 Da), and an arginine modification of +55 Da with yet unknown chemical structure. These new modifications were observed in all three aged lenses but were not found in the young lens. Several new sites of cysteine methylation were identified indicating this modification is more extensive in lens than previously thought. The results were used to estimate the extent of modification at specific sites by spectral counting. We tested the long-standing hypothesis that PTMs contribute to age-related loss of crystallin solubility by comparing spectral counts between the water-soluble and water-insoluble fractions of the aged lenses and found that the extent of deamidation was significantly increased in the water-insoluble fractions. On the basis of spectral counting, the most abundant PTMs in aged lenses were deamidations and methylated cysteines with other PTMs present at lower levels.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Biological Mass Spectrometry is used to analyse peptides and proteins. A mass spectrum generates a list of measured mass to charge ratios and intensities of ionised peptides, which is called a peak-list. In order to classify the underlying amino acid sequence, the acquired spectra are usually compared with synthetic ones. Development of suitable methods of direct peak-list comparison may be advantageous for many applications. RESULTS: The pairwise peak-list comparison is a multistage process composed of matching of peaks embedded in two peak-lists, normalisation, scaling of peak intensities and dissimilarity measures. In our analysis, we focused on binary and intensity based measures. We have modified the measures in order to comprise the mass spectrometry specific properties of mass measurement accuracy and non-matching peaks. We compared the labelling of peak-list pairs, obtained using different factors of the pairwise peak-list comparison, as being the same or different to those determined by sequence database searches. In order to elucidate how these factors influence the peak-list comparison we adopted an analysis of variance type method with the partial area under the ROC curve as a dependent variable. CONCLUSION: The analysis of variance provides insight into the relevance of various factors influencing the outcome of the pairwise peak-list comparison. For large MS/MS and PMF data sets the outcome of ANOVA analysis was consistent, providing a strong indication that the results presented here might be valid for many various types of peptide mass measurements.},

With DXMS, complete sequence coverage and single-amide (amino acid) resolution are now rapidly accomplished. DXMS is designed to work well with large proteins and when only small amounts of material are available for study. Studies can be performed upon a receptor-ligand pair as they exist on or within a living cell (in vivo) without prior purification, allowing effective in situ study of integral membrane protein receptors. We have ambitious initiatives underway to make DXMS widely available both for basic academic research studies and commercial drug discovery efforts. In this paper I present an overview of DXMS technology and highlight some of the benefits it will provide in drug discovery and basic proteomics research.},

Using data from ion trap tandem mass spectrometric (MS/MS) analysis of 102 tryptic peptides, we have analyzed multiple series of peaks within LCQ MS/MS spectra that 'spell' peptide sequences. Isotopic peaks from naturally abundant isotopes are particularly prominent even after peak centroiding on y- and b-series ions and lead to increased confidence in the identification of the precursor peptides. Sequence analysis of the MS/MS data is accomplished by finding sequences and subsequences in a hierarchical manner within the spectra.},

abstract = {Previous studies on the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) identified a conserved interaction pair comprised of Tyr204 from the P+1 loop and Glu230 at the end of the alphaF-helix. Single-point mutations of Tyr204 to Ala (Y204A) and Glu230 to Gln (E230Q) both resulted in alterations in enzymatic kinetics. To understand further the molecular basis for the altered kinetics and the structural role of each residue, we analyzed the Y204A and the E230Q mutants using hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange coupled with mass spectrometry and other biophysical techniques. The fact that the mutants exhibit distinct molecular properties, supports previous hypotheses that these two residues, although in the same interaction node, contribute to the same enzymatic functions through different molecular pathways. The Tyr204 mutation appears to affect the dynamic properties, while the Glu230 mutation affects the surface electrostatic profile of the enzyme. Furthermore, H/D exchange analysis defines the dynamic allosteric range of Tyr204 to include the catalytic loop and three additional distant surface regions, which exhibit increased deuterium exchange in the Y204A but not the E230Q mutant. Interestingly, these are the exact regions that previously showed decreased deuterium exchange upon binding of the RIalpha regulatory subunit of PKA. We propose that these sites, coupled with the P+1 loop through Tyr204, represent one of the major allosteric networks in the kinase. This coupling provides a coordinated response for substrate binding and enzyme catalysis. H/D exchange analysis also further defines the stable core of the catalytic subunit to include the alphaE, alphaF and alphaH-helix. All these observations lead to an interesting new way to view the structural architecture and allosteric conformational regulation of the protein kinase molecule.},

A cross-correlation function is then used to provide a measurement of similarity between the mass-to-charge ratios for the fragment ions predicted by amino acid sequences translated from the nucleotide database and the fragment ions observed in the tandem mass spectrum. In general, a difference greater than 0.1 between the normalized cross-correlation functions for the first- and second-ranked search results indicates a successful match between sequence and spectrum. Measurements of the deviation from maximum similarity employing the spectral reconstruction method are made. The search method employing nucleotide databases is also demonstrated on the spectra of phosphorylated peptides.

The fragmentation patterns observed in the tandem mass spectra of peptides containing covalent modifications is used to directly search and fit linear amino acid sequences in the database. Specific information relevant to sites of modification is not contained in the character-based sequence information of the databases. The search method considers each putative modification site as both modified and unmodified in one pass through the database and simultaneously considers up to three different sites of modification. The search method will identify the correct sequence if the tandem mass spectrum did not represent a modified peptide. This approach is demonstrated with peptides containing modifications such as S-carboxymethylated cysteine, oxidized methionine, phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, or phosphotyrosine. In addition, a scanning approach is used in which neutral loss scans are used to initiate the acquisition of product ion MS/MS spectra of doubly charged phosphorylated peptides during a single chromatographic run for data analysis with the database-searching algorithm. The approach described in this paper provides a convenient method to match the nascent tandem mass spectra of modified peptides to sequences in a protein database and thereby identify previously unknown sites of modification.},

This method employs a cross-correlation analysis of a CID spectrum to a reference spectrum and normalizes the cross-correlation score to the autocorrelation of the CID spectra. The query spectrum is compared by using both mass information and fragmentation patterns. Fragmentation patterns are compared to each other using a correlation function. To evaluate the specificity of the approach, a set of 2180 tandem mass spectra obtained from both triple-quadrupole tandem mass spectrometers (TSQ) and quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometers (LCQ) was created. Comparisons are performed between tandem mass spectra obtained on the same instrument type as well as between different instrument types. Accurate and reliable comparisons are demonstrated in both types of analyses. The scores obtained in the cross-comparison of TSQ and LCQ tandem mass spectra of the same peptide are found to be slightly lower than comparisons performed with spectra obtained on the same instrument type. The method appears insensitive to variations in day-to-day performance of the instrument, minor variations in fragment ion abundance, and instrumental differences inherent in the same instrument model. The use of this method of comparison is demonstrated for library searching and subtractive analysis of tandem mass spectra obtained during LC/MS/MS experiments.},

A mixture of wild-type yeast proteins has been separated on-line using reverse-phase liquid chromatography and introduced into a hybrid linear ion trap (LTQ) Fourier transform ion cylclotron resonance (FTICR) mass spectrometer, where the most abundant molecular ions were automatically isolated and fragmented. The MS(2) spectra were interpreted by an automated algorithm and the resulting fragment mass values were uploaded to the ProSight PTM search engine to identify three yeast proteins, two of which were found to be modified. Subsequent MS(3) analyses pinpointed the location of these modifications. In addition, data-dependent MS(3) experiments were performed on standard proteins and wild-type yeast proteins using the stand alone linear trap mass spectrometer. Initially, the most abundant molecular ions underwent collisionally activated dissociation, followed by data-dependent dissociation of only those MS(2) fragment ions for which a charge state could be automatically determined. The resulting spectra were processed to identify amino acid sequence tags in a robust fashion. New hybrid search modes utilized the MS(3) sequence tag and the absolute mass values of the MS(2) fragment ions to collectively provide unambiguous identification of the standard and wild-type yeast proteins from custom databases harboring a large number of post-translational modifications populated in a combinatorial fashion.},

abstract = {A novel concept of two-dimensional fragment correlation mass spectrometry and its application to peptide sequencing is described. The daughter ion (MS2) spectrum of a peptide contains the sequence information of the peptide. However, deciphering the MS2 spectrum, and thus deriving the peptide sequence is complex because of the difficulty in distinguishing the N-terminal fragments (e.g., b series) from the C-terminal fragments (e.g., y series). By taking a granddaughter ion (MS3) spectrum of a particular daughter ion, all fragment ions of the opposite terminus are eliminated in the MS3 spectrum. However, some internal fragments of the peptide will appear in the MS3 spectrum. Because internal fragments are rarely present in the MS2 spectrum, the intersection (a spectrum containing peaks that are present in both spectra) of the MS2 and MS3 spectra should contain only fragments of the same terminal type. A two-dimensional plot of the MS2 spectrum versus the intersection spectra (2-D fragment correlation mass spectrum) often gives enough information to derive the complete sequence of a peptide. This paper describes this novel technique and its application in sequencing cytochrome c and apomyoglobin. For a tryptic digest of cytochrome c, approximately 78\% of the protein sequence was determined. For the Glu-C/tryptic digest of apomyoglobin, approximately 66\% of the protein sequence was determined.},

identification, which relies on software analysis of tandem mass
spectra. Although each search engine has its strength, combining
the strengths of various search engines is not yet realizable largely
due to the lack of a unified statistical framework that is applicable
to any method. RESULTS: We have developed a universal scheme for
statistical calibration of peptide identifications. The protocol
can be used for both de novo approaches as well as database search
methods. We demonstrate the protocol using only the database search
methods. Among seven methods -SEQUEST (v27 rev12), ProbID (v1.0),
InsPecT (v20060505), Mascot (v2.1), X!Tandem (v1.0), OMSSA (v2.0)
and RAId\_DbS - calibrated, except for X!Tandem and RAId\_DbS most
methods require a rescaling according to the database size searched.
We demonstrate that our calibration protocol indeed produces unified
statistics both in terms of average number of false positives and
in terms of the probability for a peptide hit to be a true positive.
Although both the protocols for calibration and the statistics thus
calibrated are universal, the calibration formulas obtained from
one laboratory with data collected using either centroid or profile
format may not be directly usable by the other laboratories. Thus
each laboratory is encouraged to calibrate the search methods it
intends to use. We also address the importance of using spectrum-specific
statistics and possible improvement on the current calibration protocol.

we demonstrated earlier the feasibility of translating either the

E-value, which may serve as the universal statistical standard. This
protocol, although robust, may lose spectrum-specific statistics
and might require a new calibration when changes in experimental
setup occur. To mitigate these issues, we developed a new MS/MS search
tool, RAId\_aPS, that is able to provide spectrum-specific-values
for additive scoring functions. Given a selection of scoring functions
out of RAId score, K-score, Hyperscore and XCorr, RAId\_aPS generates
the corresponding score histograms of all possible peptides using
dynamic programming. Using these score histograms to assign E-values
enables a calibration-free protocol for accurate significance assignment
for each scoring function. RAId\_aPS features four different modes:
(i) compute the total number of possible peptides for a given molecular
mass range, (ii) generate the score histogram given a MS/MS spectrum
and a scoring function, (iii) reassign E-values for a list of candidate
peptides given a MS/MS spectrum and the scoring functions chosen,

only weak correlation may be present among different methods and

a second standard database search targeted to specific modifications

verification of discovered modifications and, due to increased sensitivity,
a general increase in the number of peptides with the specific modification.
The feasibility of the overall strategy has been first demonstrated

abstract = {Animal cells initiate cytokinesis in parallel with anaphase onset,
when an actomyosin ring assembles and constricts through localized
activation of the small GTPase RhoA, giving rise to a cleavage furrow.
Furrow formation relies on positional cues provided by anaphase spindle
microtubules (MTs), but how such cues are generated remains unclear.
Using chemical genetics to achieve both temporal and spatial control,
we show that the self-organized delivery of Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1)
to the midzone and its local phosphorylation of a MT-bound substrate
are critical for generating this furrow-inducing signal. When Plk1
was active but unable to target itself to this equatorial landmark,
both cortical RhoA recruitment and furrow induction failed to occur,
thus recapitulating the effects of anaphase-specific Plk1 inhibition.
Using tandem mass spectrometry and phosphospecific antibodies, we
found that Plk1 binds and directly phosphorylates the HsCYK-4 subunit
of centralspindlin (also known as MgcRacGAP) at the midzone. At serine
157, this modification creates a major docking site for the tandem
BRCT repeats of the Rho GTP exchange factor Ect2. Cells expressing
only a nonphosphorylatable form of HsCYK-4 failed to localize Ect2
at the midzone and were severely impaired in cleavage furrow formation,
implying that HsCYK-4 is Plk1's rate-limiting target upstream of
RhoA. Conversely, tethering an inhibitor-resistant allele of Plk1
to HsCYK-4 allowed furrows to form despite global inhibition of all
other Plk1 molecules in the cell. Our findings illuminate two key
mechanisms governing the initiation of cytokinesis in human cells
and illustrate the power of chemical genetics to probe such regulation
both in time and space.},

identification of spectra for which peptides are present in the database,
preventing the identification of peptides from mutated or alternatively
spliced sequences. A variety of methods has been developed to search
a spectrum against a sequence allowing for variations. Some tools
determine the sequence of the homologous protein in the related species
but do not report the peptide in the target organism. Other tools
consider variations, including modifications and mutations, in reconstructing
the target sequence. However, these tools will not work if the template
(homologous peptide) is missing in the database, and they do not
attempt to reconstruct the entire protein target sequence. De novo
identification of peptide sequences is another possibility, because
it does not require a protein database. However, the lack of database
reduces the accuracy. We present a novel proteogenomic approach,
GenoMS, that draws on the strengths of database and de novo peptide
identification methods. Protein sequence templates (i.e. proteins

identified using the database search tool InsPecT. The templates
are then used to recruit, align, and de novo sequence regions of
the target protein that have diverged from the database or are missing.
We used GenoMS to reconstruct the full sequence of an antibody by
using spectra acquired from multiple digests using different proteases.
Antibodies are a prime example of proteins that confound standard
database identification techniques. The mature antibody genes result
from large-scale genome rearrangements with flexible fusion boundaries

greater than 98\% using a diverged protein database. Using the genome

abstract = {De novo peptide sequencing has improved remarkably in the past decade
as a result of better instruments and computational algorithms. However,
de novo sequencing can correctly interpret only approximately 30\%
of high- and medium-quality spectra generated by collision-induced
dissociation (CID), which is much less than database search. This
is mainly due to incomplete fragmentation and overlap of different
ion series in CID spectra. In this study, we show that higher-energy
collisional dissociation (HCD) is of great help to de novo sequencing
because it produces high mass accuracy tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS)
spectra without the low-mass cutoff associated with CID in ion trap
instruments. Besides, abundant internal and immonium ions in the
HCD spectra can help differentiate similar peptide sequences. Taking
advantage of these characteristics, we developed an algorithm called
pNovo for efficient de novo sequencing of peptides from HCD spectra.
pNovo gave correct identifications to 80\% or more of the HCD spectra
identified by database search. The number of correct full-length
peptides sequenced by pNovo is comparable with that obtained by database
search. A distinct advantage of de novo sequencing is that deamidated
peptides and peptides with amino acid mutations can be identified
efficiently without extra cost in computation. In summary, implementation
of the HCD characteristics makes pNovo an excellent tool for de novo
peptide sequencing from HCD spectra.},

often preferred to provide short spacer lengths, surface accessibility
to the protein complexes, and must have reasonable solubility under
conditions where the native complex structure is stable. In this
study, we present a novel compact cross-linker that contains two
distinct features: (1) an alkyne tag and (2) a small molecule detection
tag (NO(2)) to maintain reasonable solubility in water. The alkyne
tag enables enrichment of the cross-linked peptides after proteolytic
cleavage and coupling of an affinity tag using alkyne-azido click
chemistry. Neutral loss of the small NO(2) moiety provides a secondary
means of detecting cross-linked peptides in MS/MS analyses, providing
additional confidence in peptide identifications. We show the labeling
efficiency of this cross-linker, which we termed CLIP (click-enabled
linker for interacting proteins) using ubiquitin. The enrichment
capability of CLIP is demonstrated for cross-linked ubiquitin in
highly complex E. coli cell lysates. Sequential collision-induced

echicetin which was demonstrated to bind to platelet GPIb and block

diploid cells have twice the volume but not twice the surface area

Further, precursor ions of longer peptides and higher charge states

to the analysis of mice with a mutation that inactivates carboxypeptidase
E, a critical enzyme in the biosynthesis of many neuroendocrine peptides.
Mice without carboxypeptidase E activity are overweight, and a key
question is the identification of the peptide or peptides responsible.
The quantitative peptidomics approach has provided some insights

abstract = {The determination of disulfide bonds is an important aspect of gaining
a comprehensive understanding of the chemical structure of a protein.
The basic strategy for obtaining this information involves the identification
of disulfide-linked peptides in digests of proteins and the characterization
of their half-cystinyl peptide constituents. Tools for disulfide
bond analysis have improved dramatically in the past two decades,
especially in terms of speed and sensitivity. This improvement is
largely due to the development of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization
(MALDI) and electrospray ionization (ESI), and complementary analyzers
with high resolution and accuracy. The process of pairing half-cystinyl
peptides is now generally achieved by comparing masses of non-reduced
and reduced aliquots of a digest of a protein that was proteolyzed
with intact disulfide bonds. Pepsin has favorable properties for
generating disulfide-linked peptides, including its acidic pH optimum,
at which disulfide bond rearrangement is precluded and protein conformations
are likely to be unfolded and accessible to cleavage, and broad substrate
specificity. These properties potentiate cleavage between all half-cystine
residues of the substrate protein. However, pepsin produces complex
digests that contain overlapping peptides due to ragged cleavage.
This complexity can produce very complex spectra and/or hamper the
ionization of some constituent peptides. It may also be more difficult
to compute which half-cystinyl sequences of the protein of interest
are disulfide-linked in non-reduced peptic digests. This ambiguity
is offset to some extent by sequence tags that may arise from ragged
cleavages and aid sequence assignments. Problems associated with
pepsin cleavage can be minimized by digestion in solvents that contain
50\% H(2) (18)O. Resultant disulfide-linked peptides have distinct
isotope profiles (combinations of isotope ratios and average mass
increases) compared to the same peptides with only (16)O in their
terminal carboxylates. Thus, it is possible to identify disulfide-linked
peptides in digests and chromatographic fractions, using these mass-specific
markers, and to rationalize mass changes upon reduction in terms
of half-cystinyl sequences of the protein of interest. Some peptides
may require additional cleavages due to their multiple disulfide
bond contents and/or tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to determine
linkages. Interpretation of the MS/MS spectra of peptides with multiple
disulfides in supplementary digests is also facilitated by the presence
of (18)O in their terminal carboxylates.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the last decade, techniques were established for the
large scale genome-wide analysis of proteins, RNA, and metabolites,
and database solutions have been developed to manage the generated
data sets. The Golm Metabolome Database for metabolite data (GMD)
represents one such effort to make these data broadly available and
to interconnect the different molecular levels of a biological system
1. As data interpretation in the light of already existing data becomes
increasingly important, these initiatives are an essential part of
current and future systems biology. RESULTS: A mass spectral library
consisting of experimentally derived tryptic peptide product ion
spectra was generated based on liquid chromatography coupled to ion
trap mass spectrometry (LC-IT-MS). Protein samples derived from Arabidopsis
thaliana, Chlamydomonas reinhardii, Medicago truncatula, and Sinorhizobium
meliloti were analysed. With currently 4,557 manually validated spectra
associated with 4,226 unique peptides from 1,367 proteins, the database
serves as a continuously growing reference data set and can be used
for protein identification and quantification in uncharacterized
biological samples. For peptide identification, several algorithms
were implemented based on a recently published study for peptide
mass fingerprinting 2 and tested for false positive and negative
rates. An algorithm which considers intensity distribution for match
correlation scores was found to yield best results. For proof of
concept, an LC-IT-MS analysis of a tryptic leaf protein digest was
converted to mzData format and searched against the mass spectral
library. The utility of the mass spectral library was also tested
for the identification of phosphorylated tryptic peptides. We included
in vivo phosphorylation sites of Arabidopsis thaliana proteins and
the identification performance was found to be improved compared
to genome-based search algorithms. Protein identification by ProMEX
is linked to other levels of biological organization such as metabolite,
pathway, and transcript data. The database is further connected to
annotation and classification services via BioMoby. CONCLUSION: The
ProMEX protein/peptide database represents a mass spectral reference
library with the capability of matching unknown samples for protein
identification. The database allows text searches based on metadata
such as experimental information of the samples, mass spectrometric
instrument parameters or unique protein identifier like AGI codes.
ProMEX integrates proteomics data with other levels of molecular
organization including metabolite, pathway, and transcript information
and may thus become a useful resource for plant systems biology studies.

and its regulation is vital for proper cellular activity. Mass spectrometry
(MS) is the enabling tool for phosphopeptide analysis, where recent
instrumentation advances in both speed and sensitivity in linear
ion trap and orbitrap technologies may yield more comprehensive phosphoproteomic
analyses in less time. Protein phosphorylation analysis by MS relies
on structural information derived through controlled peptide fragmentation.
Compared to traditional, ion-trap-based CID (collision-induced dissociation),
a more recent type of fragmentation termed HCD (higher energy collisional
dissociation) provides beam type CID MS/MS with detection of fragment
ions at high resolution in the orbitrap mass analyzer. Here we compared
HCD to traditional CID for large-scale phosphorylation analyses of
murine brain under three separate experimental conditions. These
included a same-precursor analysis where CID and HCD scans were performed
back-to-back, separate analyses of a phosphotyrosine peptide immunoprecipitation
(IP) experiment, and separate whole phosphoproteome analyses. HCD
generally provided higher search engine scores with more peptides
identified, thus out-performing CID for back-to-back experiments
for most metrics tested. However, for phosphotyrosine IPs and in
a full phosphoproteome study of mouse brain, the greater acquisition
speed of CID-only analyses provided larger data sets. We reconciled
our results with those in direct contradiction from Nagaraj N, DSouza
RCJ et. al. (J. Proteome Res. 9:6786, 2010). We conclude, for large-scale
phosphoproteomics, CID fragmentation with rapid detection in the

experiments demonstrated the promise of HCD and orbitrap detection

by studies of cells from cultures or from other mammals. We isolated
human fat cells from subcutaneous abdominal fat tissue of female
subjects and extracted histones from either purified nuclei or intact
cells. Direct acid extraction of whole adipocytes was more efficient,
yielding about 100 ?g of protein with histone content of 60\%-70\%
from 10 mL of fat cells. Differential proteolysis of the protein
extracts by trypsin or ArgC-protease followed by nanoLC/MS/MS with
alternating CID/ETD peptide sequencing identified 19 histone variants.
Four variants were found at the protein level for the first time;
particularly HIST2H4B was identified besides the only H4 isoform
earlier known to be expressed in humans. Three of the found H2A potentially
organize small nucleosomes in transcriptionally active chromatin,
while two H2AFY variants inactivate X chromosome in female cells.
HIST1H2BA and three of the identified H1 variants had earlier been
described only as oocyte or testis specific histones. H2AFX and H2AFY
revealed differential and variable N-terminal processing. Out of
78 histone modifications by acetylation/trimethylation, methylation,
dimethylation, phosphorylation and ubiquitination, identified from
six subjects, 68 were found for the first time. Only 23 of these
modifications were detected in two or more subjects, while all the
others were individual specific. The direct acid extraction of adipocytes
allows for personal epigenetic analyses of human fat tissue, for
profiling of histone modifications related to obesity, diabetes and
metabolic syndrome, as well as for selection of individual medical
treatments.},

proteomics, whereas electron transfer dissociation (ETD) has been
described as a preferred method for peptides carrying labile PTMs.
Though both of these fragmentation techniques have their obvious
advantages, they also have their own drawbacks. By combining data
from CID and ETD fragmentation, some of these disadvantages can potentially
be overcome because of the complementarity of fragment ions produced.
To evaluate alternating CID and ETD fragmentation, we analyzed a
complex mixture of phosphopeptides on an LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer.
When the CID and ETD-derived spectra were searched separately, we
observed 2504, 491, 2584, and 3249 phosphopeptide-spectrum matches
from CID alone, ETD alone, decision tree-based CID/ETD, and alternating
CID and ETD, respectively. Combining CID and ETD spectra prior to
database searching should, intuitively, be superior to either method
alone. However, when spectra from the alternating CID and ETD method
were merged prior to database searching, we observed a reduction
in the number of phosphopeptide-spectrum matches. The poorer identification
rates observed after merging CID and ETD spectra are a reflection
of a lack of optimized search algorithms for carrying out such searches
and perhaps inherent weaknesses of this approach. Thus, although
alternating CID and ETD experiments for phosphopeptide identification
are desirable for increasing the confidence of identifications, merging
spectra prior to database search has to be carefully evaluated further
in the context of the various algorithms before adopting it as a
routine strategy.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is an indispensable technology
for identification of proteins from complex mixtures. Proteins are
digested to peptides that are then identified by their fragmentation
patterns in the mass spectrometer. Thus, at its core, MS/MS protein
identification relies on the relative predictability of peptide fragmentation.
Unfortunately, peptide fragmentation is complex and not fully understood,
and what is understood is not always exploited by peptide identification
algorithms. RESULTS: We use a hybrid dynamic Bayesian network (DBN)/support
vector machine (SVM) approach to address these two problems. We train
a set of DBNs on high-confidence peptide-spectrum matches. These
DBNs, known collectively as Riptide, comprise a probabilistic model
of peptide fragmentation chemistry. Examination of the distributions
learned by Riptide allows identification of new trends, such as prevalent
a-ion fragmentation at peptide cleavage sites C-term to hydrophobic
residues. In addition, Riptide can be used to produce likelihood
scores that indicate whether a given peptide-spectrum match is correct.
A vector of such scores is evaluated by an SVM, which produces a
final score to be used in peptide identification. Using Riptide in
this way yields improved discrimination when compared to other state-of-the-art
MS/MS identification algorithms, increasing the number of positive
identifications by as much as 12\% at a 1\% false discovery rate.

In contrast, advances in proteomics technology, including phosphopeptide
enrichment, high-accuracy mass spectrometry, and associated bioinformatics
now make it possible to analyze entire phosphoproteomes. Quantitative
methods can assess the relative change in phosphorylation for several
thousand sites in a single experiment. Here we review enrichment
strategies and methods for mass spectrometric fragmentation and analysis
of phosphopeptides. We also describe different quantitative methods
and their application to problems in cell signaling and drug target
discovery. Emerging phosphoproteomics technologies are becoming more
comprehensive, robust, and generically applicable to a wide range
of questions, including areas outside traditional eukaryotic cell
signaling such as Ser/Thr/Tyr signaling in bacteria.},

using database search engines, at the core of which is a score that
measures the similarity between peptide MS/MS spectra and a protein
sequence database. The TANDEM application was developed as a freely
available database search engine for the proteomics research community.
To extend TANDEM as a platform for further research on developing
improved database scoring methods, we modified the software to allow
users to redefine the scoring function and replace the native TANDEM
scoring function while leaving the remaining core application intact.
Redefinition is performed at run time so multiple scoring functions
are available to be selected and applied from a single search engine
binary. We introduce the implementation of the pluggable scoring
algorithm and also provide implementations of two TANDEM compatible
scoring functions, one previously described scoring function compatible
with PeptideProphet and one very simple scoring function that quantitative
researchers may use to begin their development. This extension builds
on the open-source TANDEM project and will facilitate research into
and dissemination of novel algorithms for matching MS/MS spectra
to peptide sequences. The pluggable scoring schema is also compatible
with related search applications P3 and Hunter, which are part of
the X! suite of database matching algorithms. The pluggable scores
and the X! suite of applications are all written in C++. AVAILABILITY:

MS/MS spectra of tryptic peptides assigned with high probability
to an amino acid sequence (true positives) and a set of certified
false (true negative) assignments for analysis of the amino terminus.
A similar database was created for analysis of neutral loss at the
carboxy termini using a data set of chymotryptic peptides. The analysis
demonstrated that the presence of an internal basic residue, limiting
proton mobility, has a profound effect on neutral loss. Peptides
with fully mobile protons demonstrated minimal neutral loss, with
the exception of amide bonds with proline on the carboxy terminal
side, which created an intense neutral loss peak. In contrast, peptides
with partial proton mobility contained many amino acids on either
side of the amide bond associated with a strong neutral loss peak.
Most notable among these was proline on the carboxy terminal side
of an amide bond and aspartic acid on the amino terminal side of
a bond. All results were found to be consistent for doubly and triply
charged peptides and after adjustment for pairings across the amide
bonds with particularly labile residues. The carboxy terminal of
chymotryptic peptides also demonstrated significant neutral loss

peptide backbone fragmentation, resulting in little to no peptide

limited peptide backbone fragmentation. However, when these peptides
were fragmented using ETD, peptide backbone fragmentation produced
a complete or almost complete series of ions and thus extensive peptide
sequence information. In addition, labile PTMs remained intact. These
examples illustrate the utility of ETD as an advantageous tool in

sequencing of proteins by mass spectrometry most frequently involves
reductive cleavage and alkylation of disulfide links followed by
enzymatic digestion. However, when using this approach, information
on cysteine-cysteine contacts within the protein is lost. Mass spectrometric
characterisation of peptides containing intra-chain disulfides is
a challenging analytical task, because peptide bonds within the disulfide
loop are believed to be resistant to fragmentation. In this contribution
we show recent results on the fragmentation of intra and inter-peptide
disulfide bonds of proteolytic peptides by nano electrospray ionisation
collision-induced dissociation (nanoESI CID). Disulfide bridge-containing
peptides obtained from proteolytic digests were submitted to low-energy
nanoESI CID using a quadrupole time-of-flight (Q-TOF) instrument
as a mass analyser. Fragmentation of the gaseous peptide ions gave
rise to a set of b and y-type fragment ions which enabled derivation
of the sequence of the amino acids located outside the disulfide
loop. Surprisingly, careful examination of the fragment-ion spectra
of peptide ions comprising an intramolecular disulfide bridge revealed
the presence of low-abundance fragment ions formed by the cleavage

The modification was comprehensively validated by Western blot, tandem MS, and high-performance liquid chromatography of synthetic peptides, isotopic labeling, and identification of multiple Kmal substrate proteins. Kmal is a dynamic and evolutionarily conserved PTM observed in mammalian cells and bacterial cells. In addition, we demonstrate that Sirt5, a member of the class III lysine deacetylases, can catalyze lysine demalonylation and lysine desuccinylation reactions both in vitro and in vivo. This result suggests the possibility of nondeacetylation activity of other class III lysine deacetylases, especially those without obvious acetylation protein substrates. Our results therefore reveal a new type of PTM pathway and identify the first enzyme that can regulate lysine malonylation and lysine succinylation status.},

abstract = {Cell surface and extracellular proteins are O-glycosylated, where
the most abundant type of O-glycosylation in proteins is the GalNAc
attachment to serine (Ser) or threonine (Thr) in the protein chain
by an a-glycosidic linkage. Most eukaryotic nuclear and cytoplasmic
proteins modified by a-linked O-GlcNAc to Ser or Thr exhibit reciprocal
O-GlcNAc glycosylation and phosphorylation during the cell cycle,
cell stimulation, and/or cell growth. Less-investigated types of
O-glycosylation are O-fucosylation, O-mannosylation, and O-glucosylation,
but they are functionally of high relevance for early stages of development
and for vital physiological functions of proteins. Glycosaminoglycans
are a-linked to proteoglycans via a xylose-containing tetrasaccharide,
represented by linear chains of repetitive disaccharides modified
by carboxylates and O- or/and N-linked sulfates. Analysis of O-glycosylation
by mass spectrometry (MS) is a complex task due to the high structural
diversity of glycan and protein factors. The parameters in structural
analysis of O-glycans include determination of (i) O-glycosylation
attachment sites in the protein sequence, (ii) the type of attached
monosaccharide moiety, (iii) a core type in the case of GalNAc O-glycosylation,
(iv) the type and size of the oligosaccharide portion, (v) carbohydrate
branching patterns, (vi) the site of monosaccharide glycosidic linkages,
(vii) the anomericity of glycosidic linkages, and (viii) covalent
modifications of the sugar backbone chains by carbohydrate- and noncarbohydrate-type
of substitutents. Classical and novel analytical strategies for identification
and sequencing of O-glycans by MS are described. These include methods
to analyze O-glycans after total or partial release from the parent
protein by chemical or enzymatic approach or to analyze O-glycosylated
peptides by mapping and sequencing from proteolytic mixtures. A recombination
process of multiply charged glycopeptides with electrons by electron
capture dissociation Fourier transform ion cyclotrone resonance (FTICR)-MS
has been introduced and is instrumental for nonergodic polypeptide
backbone cleavages without losses of labile glycan substituents.
A method for O-glycoscreening under increased sensitivity and efficient
sequencing as a combination of an on-line coupling of capillary electrophoresis
separation, as well as an automated MS-tandem MS (MS/MS) switching
under variable energy conditions collision-induced dissociation (CID)
protocol, is beneficial for determination of O-acetylation and oversulfation
(Bindila et al., 2004a; Zamfir et al., 2004a). O-glycomics by robotized
chip-electrospray/ionization (ESI)-MS and MS/MS on the quadrupole
time-of-flight (QTOF) and FTICR analyzers, accurate mass determination,
and software for assignment of fragmentation spectra represent essentials
for high-throughput (HTP) in serial screenings (Bindila et al., 2004b;
Froesch et al., 2004; Vakhrushev et al., 2005). Dimerization of intact
O-glycosylated proteins can be investigated by matrix-assisted laser

coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC/LC-MS/MS) and subsequent
database searching with algorithms such as SEQUEST. Here, we describe
a probability-based evaluation of false positive rates associated
with peptide identifications from three different human proteome
samples. Peptides from human plasma, human mammary epithelial cell
(HMEC) lysate, and human hepatocyte (Huh)-7.5 cell lysate were separated
by strong cation exchange (SCX) chromatography coupled offline with
reversed-phase capillary LC-MS/MS analyses. The MS/MS spectra were
first analyzed by SEQUEST, searching independently against both normal
and sequence-reversed human protein databases, and the false positive
rates of peptide identifications for the three proteome samples were
then analyzed and compared. The observed false positive rates of
peptide identifications for human plasma were significantly higher
than those for the human cell lines when identical filtering criteria
were used, suggesting that the false positive rates are significantly
dependent on sample characteristics, particularly the number of proteins
found within the detectable dynamic range. Two new sets of filtering
criteria are proposed for human plasma and human cell lines, respectively,
to provide an overall confidence of >95\% for peptide identifications.
The new criteria were compared, using a normalized elution time (NET)

acts as a coarse, lossless filter with respect to the SEQUEST and
ProFound scoring schemes, reducing the number of distance computations

specificity over a peptide precursor mass filter, reducing the number
of returned candidates by an order of magnitude. Run time measurements

to develop parallel collision-induced-dissociation mass spectrometry

increased signal intensities (2-400-fold) and number of sequence
ions. This improvement is attributed to the fact that p2CID MS virtually
samples all the ions generated by electrospray ionization, including
intact and fragment ions of different charge states from a peptide.
We implement the method using a quadrupole time-of-flight tandem
mass spectrometer. The instrument is operated in TOF-MS mode that
allows the ions from source region broadband-passing the first mass
analyzer to enter the collision cell. Cone voltage and collision
energy are investigated to optimize the outcome of the two parallel
CID processes. In the in-source parallel CID, elevated cone voltage
produces singly charged intact peptide ions and large fragment ions,
as well as decreases the charge-state distribution of peptide ions
mainly to double and single charges. The in-collision-cell parallel
CID is optimized to dissociate the ions from the source region to
produce small and medium fragment ions. The method of p2CID MS is
especially useful for sequencing of large peptides with labile amide

and specificity for phosphosite localization as the published Ascore,
which is mainly used in conjunction with Sequest. The MD-score was
evaluated using liquid chromatography-tandem MS data of 180 individually
synthesized phosphopeptides with precisely known phosphorylation
sites. We tested the MD-score for a wide range of commonly available
fragmentation methods and found it to be applicable throughout with
high statistical significance. However, the different fragmentation
techniques differ strongly in their ability to localize phosphorylation
sites. At 1\% false localization rate, the highest number of correctly
assigned phosphopeptides was achieved by higher energy collision
induced dissociation in combination with an Orbitrap mass analyzer
followed very closely by low resolution ion trap spectra obtained
after electron transfer dissociation. Both these methods are significantly
better than low resolution spectra acquired after collision induced
dissociation and multi stage activation. Score thresholds determined
from simple calibration functions for each fragmentation method were
stable over replicate analyses of the phosphopeptide set. The MD-score
outperforms the Ascore for tyrosine phosphorylated peptides and we
further show that the ability to call sites correctly increases with
increasing distance of two candidate sites within a peptide sequence.
The MD-score does not require complex computational steps which makes
it attractive in terms of practical utility. We provide all mass

the use of accurate masses for fragments increased the number of

contribution to the identified peptide data sets compared to HCD

fewer peptide identifications than SEQUEST (by 1.3-2.3 fold) and
CID, HCD, and ETD provided similar contributions to identified peptides.
Evaluation of de novo sequencing and the UStags method for more intense

(e.g., ? 7 amino acids) than either CID or ETD. Both the FDR-controlled
SEQUEST and Mascot scoring methods provided peptide data sets that
were affected by the decoy database used and mass tolerances applied

while the UStags method provided the most consistent peptide data
sets (>90\% overlap). The m/z ranges in which CID, HCD, and ETD contributed
the largest number of peptide identifications were substantially
overlapping. This work suggests that the three peptide ion fragmentation
methods are complementary and that maximizing the number of peptide

the informatics tools and methods applied. These results also suggest
that the decoy strategy may inaccurately estimate identification

abstract = {As proteomics continues to establish itself as an effective postgenomic
research tool, there is an increasingly urgent need for efficient,
automated analysis techniques capable of effectively dealing with
the vast amounts of data generated via mass spectrometry. Wholesale
analysis packages, often used to deal with these enormous amounts
of data, may benefit from supplementary, targeted analyses as current
research begins to emphasize posttranscriptional/translational protein
modifications, protein truncations, and poorly characterized mutations.
We demonstrate the application of a new analysis technique based
on mathematical correlation that is computationally efficient and
robust against different instruments, noise levels, and experimental
conditions. We have previously shown that this technique is able
to extract pertinent mass shift signals from MS data, corresponding
to the neutral loss of a modification from a peptide, e.g., a loss
of 79.97 Th from phosphorylated tyrosine. Here we show that an extension
of this method is applicable to MS and MS/MS data in general, allowing
visualization of ions that produce a particular mass shift signal,
be it from differential stable isotope labeling, overlap of fragment
ions in a series, or ions that produce a neutral loss. The application
of this method allows the researcher to discover individual features,
such as the presence of specific modified or isotopically labeled
peptides, to eliminate overlapping fragment ion series, and to localize
specific sites of modification.},

abstract = {Mass spectrometry has become a key technology for modern large-scale
protein sequencing. Tandem mass spectrometry, the process of peptide
ion dissociation followed by mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) analysis,

in mass spectrometry now permit two discrete, and complementary,
types of peptide ion fragmentation: collision-activated dissociation
(CAD) and electron transfer dissociation (ETD) on a single instrument.
To exploit this complementarity and increase sequencing success rates,
we designed and embedded a data-dependent decision tree algorithm
(DT) to make unsupervised, real-time decisions of which fragmentation
method to use based on precursor charge and m/z. Applying the DT
to large-scale proteome analyses of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and
human embryonic stem cells, we identified 53,055 peptides in total,
which was greater than by using CAD (38,293) or ETD (39,507) alone.
In addition, the DT method also identified 7,422 phosphopeptides,
compared to either 2,801 (CAD) or 5,874 (ETD) phosphopeptides.},

engines to identify peptides from tandem mass spectra. Many of these
algorithms score potential identifications by evaluating the number
of fragment ions matched between each peptide sequence and an observed
spectrum. These systems, however, generally do not distinguish between
matching an intense peak and matching a minor peak. We have developed
a statistical model to score peptide matches that is based upon the
multivariate hypergeometric distribution. This scorer, part of the
"MyriMatch" database search engine, places greater emphasis on matching
intense peaks. The probability that the best match for each spectrum
has occurred by random chance can be employed to separate correct
matches from random ones. We evaluated this software on data sets
from three different laboratories employing three different ion trap
instruments. Employing a novel system for testing discrimination,
we demonstrate that stratifying peaks into multiple intensity classes
improves the discrimination of scoring. We compare MyriMatch results
to those of Sequest and X!Tandem, revealing that it is capable of
higher discrimination than either of these algorithms. When minimal
peak filtering is employed, performance plummets for a scoring model
that does not stratify matched peaks by intensity. On the other hand,
we find that MyriMatch discrimination improves as more peaks are
retained in each spectrum. MyriMatch also scales well to tandem mass
spectra from high-resolution mass analyzers. These findings may indicate
limitations for existing database search scorers that count matched

digests may produce peptides that do not follow these rules. In this
study, we examine 2568 peptides generated through proteinase K digestion,
a technique that produces a greater diversity of basic residue content

near the N-terminus of a peptide can lead to prominent b series peaks
rather than the intense y series peaks associated with tryptic peptides.
The effects of presence and position for arginine, lysine, and histidine
are explored separately and in combination. Arg shows the most dominant
effects followed by His and then by Lys. Fragment ions containing
basic residues produce more intense peaks than those without basic
residues. Doubly charged precursor ions have generally been modeled
as producing only singly charged fragment ions, but fragment ions
that contain two basic residues may accept both protons during fragmentation.

methodology for high-throughput glycan identification and characterization.
Fragmentation of glycans from high energy collision-induced dissociation
generates ions from glycosidic as well as internal cleavages. The
cross-ring ions resulting from internal cleavages provide additional
information that is important to reveal the type of linkage between
monosaccharides. This information, however, is not incorporated into
the current programs for analyzing glycan mass spectra. As a result,
they can rarely distinguish from the mass spectra isomeric oligosaccharides,
which have the same saccharide composition but different types of
sequences, branches or linkages. RESULTS: In this paper, we describe
a novel algorithm for glycan characterization using MS/MS. This algorithm
consists of three steps. First, we develop a scoring scheme to identify
potential bond linkages between monosaccharides, based on the appearance
pattern of cross-ring ions. Next, we use a dynamic programming algorithm
to determine the most probable oligosaccharide structures from the
mass spectrum. Finally, we re-evaluate these oligosaccharide structures,
taking into account the double fragmentation ions. We also show the
preliminary results of testing our algorithm on several MS/MS spectra
of oligosaccharides. AVAILABILITY: The program GLYCH is available

proteomics workflow for protein characterization in complex samples.
The peptide fragmentation spectra generated by these workflows exhibit
characteristic fragmentation patterns that can be used to identify
the peptide. In other fields, where the compounds of interest do
not have the convenient linear structure of peptides, fragmentation
spectra are identified by comparing new spectra with libraries of
identified spectra, an approach called spectral matching. In contrast
to sequence-based tandem mass spectrometry search engines used for
peptides, spectral matching can make use of the intensities of fragment
peaks in library spectra to assess the quality of a match. We evaluate
a hidden Markov model approach (HMMatch) to spectral matching, in
which many examples of a peptide's fragmentation spectrum are summarized
in a generative probabilistic model that captures the consensus and
variation of each peak's intensity. We demonstrate that HMMatch has
good specificity and superior sensitivity, compared to sequence database
search engines such as X!Tandem. HMMatch achieves good results from
relatively few training spectra, is fast to train, and can evaluate
many spectra per second. A statistical significance model permits
HMMatch scores to be compared with each other, and with other peptide
identification tools, on a unified scale. HMMatch shows a similar
degree of concordance with X!Tandem, Mascot, and NIST's MS Search,
as they do with each other, suggesting that each tool can assign
peptides to spectra that the others miss. Finally, we show that it

library search is a new and promising computational approach to mass
spectrometry-based protein identification. However, its potential
in identification of unanticipated post-translational modifications
has rarely been explored. The existing spectral library search tools
are designed to match the query spectrum to the reference library
spectra with the same peptide mass. Thus, spectra of peptides with
unanticipated modifications cannot be identified. RESULTS: In this
article, we present an open spectral library search tool, named pMatch.
It extends the existing library search algorithms in at least three
aspects to support the identification of unanticipated modifications.
First, the spectra in library are optimized with the full peptide
sequence information to better tolerate the peptide fragmentation
pattern variations caused by some modification(s). Second, a new
scoring system is devised, which uses charge-dependent mass shifts
for peak matching and combines a probability-based model with the
general spectral dot-product for scoring. Third, a target-decoy strategy
is used for false discovery rate control. To demonstrate the effectiveness
of pMatch, a library search experiment was conducted on a public
dataset with over 40,000 spectra in comparison with SpectraST, the
most popular library search engine. Additional validations were done
on four published datasets including over 150,000 spectra. The results
showed that pMatch can effectively identify unanticipated modifications
and significantly increase spectral identification rate. AVAILABILITY:

abstract = {The unambiguous assignment of tandem mass spectra (MS/MS) to peptide
sequences remains a key unsolved problem in proteomics. Spectral
library search strategies have emerged as a promising alternative
for peptide identification, in which MS/MS spectra are directly compared
against a reference library of confidently assigned spectra. Two
problems relate to library size. First, reference spectral libraries
are limited to rediscovery of previously identified peptides and
are not applicable to new peptides, because of their incomplete coverage
of the human proteome. Second, problems arise when searching a spectral
library the size of the entire human proteome. We observed that traditional
dot product scoring methods do not scale well with spectral library
size, showing reduction in sensitivity when library size is increased.
We show that this problem can be addressed by optimizing scoring
metrics for spectrum-to-spectrum searches with large spectral libraries.
MS/MS spectra for the 1.3 million predicted tryptic peptides in the
human proteome are simulated using a kinetic fragmentation model
(MassAnalyzer version2.1) to create a proteome-wide simulated spectral
library. Searches of the simulated library increase MS/MS assignments
by 24\% compared with Mascot, when using probabilistic and rank based
scoring methods. The proteome-wide coverage of the simulated library
leads to 11\% increase in unique peptide assignments, compared with
parallel searches of a reference spectral library. Further improvement
is attained when reference spectra and simulated spectra are combined
into a hybrid spectral library, yielding 52\% increased MS/MS assignments
compared with Mascot searches. Our study demonstrates the advantages
of using probabilistic and rank based scores to improve performance
of spectrum-to-spectrum search strategies.},

abstract = {Identifying peptides from mass spectrometric fragmentation data (MS/MS
spectra) using search strategies that map protein sequences to spectra
is computationally expensive. An alternative strategy uses direct
spectrum-to-spectrum matching against a reference library of previously
observed MS/MS that has the advantage of evaluating matches using
fragment ion intensities and other ion types than the simple set
normally used. However, this approach is limited by the small sizes
of the available peptide MS/MS libraries and the inability to evaluate
the rate of false assignments. In this study, we observed good performance
of simulated spectra generated by the kinetic model implemented in
MassAnalyzer (Zhang, Z. (2004) Prediction of low-energy collision-induced

search programs X!Hunter and BiblioSpec and similar results in comparison
with the spectrum-to-sequence program Mascot. We also demonstrate
the use of simulated spectra for searching against decoy sequences
to estimate false discovery rates. Although we found lower score
discrimination with spectrum-to-spectrum searches than with Mascot,
particularly for higher charge forms, comparable peptide assignments
with low false discovery rate were achieved by examining consensus
between X!Hunter and Mascot, filtering results by mass accuracy,
and ignoring score thresholds. Protein identification results are
comparable to those achieved when evaluating consensus between Sequest
and Mascot. Run times with large scale data sets using X!Hunter with
the simulated spectral library are 7 times faster than Mascot and
80 times faster than Sequest with the human International Protein
Index (IPI) database. We conclude that simulated spectral libraries
greatly expand the search space available for spectrum-to-spectrum
searching while enabling principled analyses and that the approach
can be used in consensus strategies for large scale studies while
reducing search times.},

DXMS analysis was then correlated with the propensity of such targets to crystallize and was further used to define truncations that improved crystallization. Truncations that were defined solely on DXMS analysis demonstrated greatly improved crystallization and have been used for structure determination.

Here we applied the isotope-coded affinity tag (ICAT) approach to quantitative protein profiling, in this case proteins that copurified with lipid raft plasma membrane domains isolated from control and stimulated Jurkat human T cells. With the ICAT approach, cysteine residues of the two related protein isolates were covalently labeled with isotopically normal and heavy versions of the same reagent, respectively. Following proteolytic cleavage of combined labeled proteins, peptides were fractionated by multidimensional chromatography and subsequently analyzed via automated tandem mass spectrometry. Individual tandem mass spectrometry spectra were searched against a human sequence database, and a variety of recently developed, publicly available software applications were used to sort, filter, analyze, and compare the results of two repetitions of the same experiment. In particular, robust statistical modeling algorithms were used to assign measures of confidence to both peptide sequences and the proteins from which they were likely derived, identified via the database searches. We show that by applying such statistical tools to the identification of T cell lipid raft-associated proteins, we were able to estimate the accuracy of peptide and protein identifications made. These tools also allow for determination of the false positive rate as a function of user-defined data filtering parameters, thus giving the user significant control over and information about the final output of large-scale proteomic experiments. With the ability to assign probabilities to all identifications, the need for manual verification of results is substantially reduced, thus making the rapid evaluation of large proteomic datasets possible.

abstract = {There are many computer programs that can match tandem mass spectra of peptides to database-derived sequences; however, situations can arise where mass spectral data cannot be correlated with any database sequence. In such cases, sequences can be automatically deduced de novo, without recourse to sequence databases, and the resulting peptide sequences can be used to perform homologous nonexact searches of sequence databases. This article describes details on how to implement both a de novo sequencing program called \&quot;Lutefisk,\&quot; and a version of FASTA that has been modified to account for sequence ambiguities inherent in tandem mass spectrometry data.},

abstract = {Lipid rafts were prepared according to standard protocols from Jurkat T cells stimulated via T cell receptor/CD28 cross-linking and from control (unstimulated) cells. Co-isolating proteins from the control and stimulated cell preparations were labeled with isotopically normal (d0) and heavy (d8) versions of the same isotope-coded affinity tag (ICAT) reagent, respectively. Samples were combined, proteolyzed, and resultant peptides fractionated via cation exchange chromatography. Cysteine-containing (ICAT-labeled) peptides were recovered via the biotin tag component of the ICAT reagents by avidin-affinity chromatography. On-line micro-capillary liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry was performed on both avidin-affinity (ICAT-labeled) and flow-through (unlabeled) fractions. Initial peptide sequence identification was by searching recorded tandem mass spectrometry spectra against a human sequence data base using SEQUEST trade mark software. New statistical data modeling algorithms were then applied to the SEQUEST trade mark search results. These allowed for discrimination between likely \&quot;correct\&quot; and \&quot;incorrect\&quot; peptide assignments, and from these the inferred proteins that they collectively represented, by calculating estimated probabilities that each peptide assignment and subsequent protein identification was a member of the \&quot;correct\&quot; population. For convenience, the resultant lists of peptide sequences assigned and the proteins to which they corresponded were filtered at an arbitrarily set cut-off of 0.5 (i.e. 50\% likely to be \&quot;correct\&quot;) and above and compiled into two separate datasets. In total, these data sets contained 7667 individual peptide identifications, which represented 2669 unique peptide sequences, corresponding to 685 proteins and related protein groups.},

abstract = {A database of 5500 unique peptide tandem mass spectra acquired in
an ion trap mass spectrometer was assembled for peptides derived
from proteins digested with trypsin. Peptides were identified initially
from their tandem mass spectra by the SEQUEST algorithm and subsequently
validated manually. Two different statistical methods were used to
identify sequence-dependent fragmentation patterns that could be
used to improve fragmentation models incorporated into current peptide
sequencing and database search algorithms. The currently accepted
"mobile proton" model was expanded to derive a new classification
scheme for peptide mass spectra, the "relative proton mobility" scale,
which considers peptide ion charge state and amino acid composition
to categorize peptide mass spectra into peptide ions containing "nonmobile",
"partially mobile", or "mobile" protons. Quantitation of amide bond
fragmentation, both N- and C-terminal to any given amino acid, as
well as the positional effect of an amino acid in a peptide and peptide
length on such fragmentation, has been determined. Peptide bond cleavage
propensities, both positive (i.e., enhanced) and negative (i.e.,
suppressed), were determined and ranked in order of their cleavage
preferences as primary, secondary, or tertiary cleavage effects.
For example, primary positive cleavage effects were observed for
Xaa-Pro and Asp-Xaa bond cleavage for mobile and nonmobile peptide
ion categories, respectively. We also report specific pairwise interactions
(e.g., Asn-Gly) that result in enhanced amide bond cleavages analogous
to those observed in solution-phase chemistry. Peptides classified
as nonmobile gave low or insignificant scores, below reported MS/MS
score thresholds (cutoff filters), indicating that incorporation
of the relative proton mobility scale classification would lead to
improvements in current MS/MS scoring functions.},

In this approach, relationships between m/z peaks are represented by attractive and repulsive springs, and the vibrational modes of the spring system are used to infer information about the peaks (such as "likely b-ion" or "likely y-ion"). We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by comparison with other de novo sequencers on test sets of ion-trap and QTOF spectra, including spectra of mixtures of peptides. On all datasets, we outperform the other sequencers. Along with spectral graph theory techniques, the new de novo sequencer EigenMS incorporates another improvement of independent interest: robust statistical methods for recalibration of time-of-flight mass measurements. Robust recalibration greatly outperforms simple least-squares recalibration, achieving about three times the accuracy for one QTOF dataset.},

abstract = {Chemical cross-linking in combination with mass spectrometric analysis offers the potential to obtain low-resolution structural information from proteins and protein complexes. Identification of peptides connected by a cross-link provides direct evidence for the physical interaction of amino acid side chains, information that can be used for computational modeling purposes. Despite impressive advances that were made in recent years, the number of experimentally observed cross-links still falls below the number of possible contacts of cross-linkable side chains within the span of the cross-linker. Here, we propose two complementary experimental strategies to expand cross-linking data sets. First, enrichment of cross-linked peptides by size exclusion chromatography selects cross-linked peptides based on their higher molecular mass, thereby depleting the majority of unmodified peptides present in proteolytic digests of cross-linked samples. Second, we demonstrate that the use of proteases in addition to trypsin, such as Asp-N, can additionally boost the number of observable cross-linking sites. The benefits of both SEC enrichment and multiprotease digests are demonstrated on a set of model proteins and the improved workflow is applied to the characterization of the 20S proteasome from rabbit and Schizosaccharomyces pombe.},

abstract = {The covalent attachment of SUMO (small ubiquitin-like modifier) to other intracellular proteins affects a broad range of nuclear processes in yeast and animals, including chromatin maintenance, transcription, and transport across the nuclear envelope, as well as protects proteins from ubiquitin addition. Substantial increases in SUMOylated proteins upon various stresses have also implicated this modification in the general stress response. To help understand the role(s) of SUMOylation in plants, we developed a stringent method to isolate SUMO-protein conjugates from Arabidopsis thaliana that exploits a tagged SUMO1 variant that faithfully replaces the wild-type protein. Following purification under denaturing conditions, SUMOylated proteins were identified by tandem mass spectrometry from both nonstressed plants and those exposed to heat and oxidative stress. The list of targets is enriched for factors that direct SUMOylation and for nuclear proteins involved in chromatin remodeling/repair, transcription, RNA metabolism, and protein trafficking. Targets of particular interest include histone H2B, components in the LEUNIG/TOPLESS corepressor complexes, and proteins that control histone acetylation and DNA methylation, which affect genome-wide transcription. SUMO attachment site(s) were identified in a subset of targets, including SUMO1 itself to confirm the assembly of poly-SUMO chains. SUMO1 also becomes conjugated with ubiquitin during heat stress, thus connecting these two posttranslational modifications in plants. Taken together, we propose that SUMOylation represents a rapid and global mechanism for reversibly manipulating plant chromosomal functions, especially during environmental stress.},

In some approaches, the experimental data are peptide molecular weights from the digestion of a protein by an enzyme. Other approaches use tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data from one or more peptides. Still others combine mass data with amino acid sequence data. We present results from a new computer program, Mascot, which integrates all three types of search. The scoring algorithm is probability based, which has a number of advantages: (i) A simple rule can be used to judge whether a result is significant or not. This is particularly useful in guarding against false positives. (ii) Scores can be compared with those from other types of search, such as sequence homology. (iii) Search parameters can be readily optimised by iteration. The strengths and limitations of probability-based scoring are discussed, particularly in the context of high throughput, fully automated protein identification.},
